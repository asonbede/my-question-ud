        },
        correctAnswer: "b",
        explanation: `
        Kinesis Data Streams supports changes to the data record retention period of your stream. 
        A Kinesis data stream is an ordered sequence of data records meant to be written 
        to and read from in real-time. Data records are therefore stored in shards in your stream temporarily.

        The time period from when a record is added to when it is no longer 
        accessible is called the retention period. 
        A Kinesis data stream stores records from 24 hours by default to a maximum of 168 hours.
        
        This is the reason why there are missing data in your S3 bucket. 
        To fix this, you can either configure your sensors to send the data everyday
         instead of every other day or alternatively, 
         you can increase the retention period of your Kinesis data stream.
        
        The option that says: There is a problem in the sensors. 
        They probably had some intermittent connection hence, 
        the data is not sent to the stream is incorrect. 
        You already verified that the sensors are working as they should be hence, 
        this is not the root cause of the issue.
        
        The option that says: By default, Amazon S3 stores the data for 1 day and moves it to Amazon Glacier 
        is incorrect because by default, Amazon S3 does not store the data for 1 day only and move 
        it to Amazon Glacier.
        
        The option that says: Your AWS account was hacked and someone has deleted
         some data in your Kinesis stream is incorrect. 
         Although this could be a possibility, you should verify first if there are
          other more probable reasons for the missing data in your S3 bucket.
           Be sure to follow and apply security best practices as well to prevent being hacked by someone.
        
        By default, the data records are only accessible for 24 hours from the time
         they are added to a Kinesis stream, which depicts the root cause of this issue.

        },
        correctAnswer: "b",
        explanation: `
        Explanation

        AWS Transit Gateway provides a hub and spoke design for connecting VPCs and on-premises networks. 
        You can attach all your hybrid connectivity (VPN and Direct Connect connections) 
        to a single Transit Gateway consolidating and controlling your organization's entire AWS routing 
        configuration in one place. 
        It also controls how traffic is routed among all the connected spoke networks using route tables. 
        This hub and spoke model simplifies management and reduces operational costs because VPCs 
        only connect to the Transit Gateway to gain access to the connected networks.
        
        By attaching a transit gateway to a Direct Connect gateway using a transit virtual interface,
         you can manage a single connection for multiple VPCs or VPNs that are in the same AWS Region. 
         You can also advertise prefixes from on-premises to AWS and from AWS to on-premises.
        
        The AWS Transit Gateway and AWS Direct Connect solution simplify the management of connections 
        between an Amazon VPC and your networks over a private connection. 
        It can also minimize network costs, improve bandwidth throughput, 
        and provide a more reliable network experience than Internet-based connections.
        
        Hence, the correct answer is: Create a new Direct Connect gateway and integrate
         it with the existing Direct Connect connection. 
         Set up a Transit Gateway between AWS accounts and associate it with the Direct Connect gateway.
        
        The option that says: Set up another Direct Connect connection for each and every
         new AWS account that will be added is incorrect because this solution entails a 
         significant amount of additional cost. Setting up a single DX connection requires a 
         substantial budget and takes a lot of time to establish. It also has high
          management overhead since you will need to manage all of 
          the Direct Connect connections for all AWS accounts.
        
        The option that says: Create a new AWS VPN CloudHub. 
        Set up a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection for 
        additional AWS accounts is incorrect because a VPN connection is not 
        capable of providing consistent and dedicated access to the on-premises network services. 
        Take note that a VPN connection traverses the public Internet and doesn't use a dedicated connection.
        
        The option that says: Set up a new Direct Connect gateway and 
        integrate it with the existing Direct Connect connection. Configure a VPC peering connection
         between AWS accounts and associate it with Direct Connect gateway is incorrect because VPC
          peering is not supported in a Direct Connect connection. 
          VPC peering does not support transitive peering relationships.

a lifecycle policy that moves older data to Glacier every month. 
There is a strict compliance requirement where a surprise audit 
can happen at anytime and you should be able to retrieve the required data in under 15 minutes 
under all circumstances. Your manager instructed you to ensure that retrieval capacity is 
available when you need it and should handle up to 150 MB/s of retrieval throughput.   
Which of the following should you do to meet the above requirement? (Select TWO.)

        answers: {
          a: "Use Expedited retrievals to access the financial data And Purchase provisioned retrival capacity",
          b: "Retrieving the data using Amazon Glacier Select",
          c: "Using Bulk Retrieval to access the financial data ",
          d: "Specifying a range, or portion, of the financial data archive to retrieve",
        },
        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: `
        Explanation

        Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data when occasional urgent
         requests for a subset of archives are required. 
         For all but the largest archives (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals are 
         typically made available within 1â€“5 minutes. 
         Provisioned Capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it.
        
        To make an Expedited, Standard, or Bulk retrieval, set the Tier parameter in 
        the Initiate Job (POST jobs) REST API request to the option you want, 
        or the equivalent in the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs. 
        If you have purchased provisioned capacity, then all expedited retrievals are automatically served
         through your provisioned capacity.
        
        Provisioned capacity ensures that your retrieval capacity for expedited retrievals 
        is available when you need it. Each unit of capacity provides that at least three expedited retrievals 
        can be performed every five minutes and provides up to 150 MB/s of retrieval throughput. 
        You should purchase provisioned retrieval capacity if your workload requires 
        highly reliable and predictable access to a subset of your data in minutes. 
        Without provisioned capacity Expedited retrievals are accepted, 
        except for rare situations of unusually high demand. 
        However, if you require access to Expedited retrievals under all circumstances, 
        you must purchase provisioned retrieval capacity.
        
        
        
        Retrieving the data using Amazon Glacier Select is incorrect because this is not 
        an archive retrieval option and is primarily used to perform filtering 
        operations using simple Structured Query Language (SQL) statements directly 
        on your data archive in Glacier.
        
        Using Bulk Retrieval to access the financial data is incorrect because bulk 
        retrievals typically complete within 5â€“12 hours hence, this does not satisfy 
        the requirement of retrieving the data within 15 minutes. 
        The provisioned capacity option is also not compatible with Bulk retrievals.
        
        Specifying a range, or portion, of the financial data archive to retrieve is incorrect 
        because using ranged archive retrievals is not enough to meet the requirement of 
        retrieving the whole archive in the given timeframe. 
        In addition, it does not provide additional retrieval capacity which is 
        what the provisioned capacity option can offer.

        When running your primary Amazon RDS Instance as a Multi-AZ deployment, 
        can you use the standby instance for read and write operations?
        
        Explanation
        
        The answer is No. The standby instance will not perform any read and write operations while
         the primary instance is running.
        
        Multi-AZ deployments for the MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and PostgreSQL engines
        utilize synchronous physical replication to keep data on the standby up-to-date with the primary.
        Multi-AZ deployments for the SQL Server engine use synchronous logical replication 
        to achieve the same result, employing SQL Server-native Mirroring technology. 
        Both approaches safeguard your data in the event of a DB Instance failure or loss of an Availability Zone.
        
        If a storage volume on your primary instance fails in a Multi-AZ deployment, 
        Amazon RDS automatically initiates a failover to 
        the up-to-date standby (or to a replica in the case of Amazon Aurora). 
        Compare this to a Single-AZ deployment: in case of a Single-AZ database failure, 
        a user-initiated point-in-time-restore operation will be required. 
        This operation can take several hours to complete, 
        and any data updates that occurred after the latest 
        restorable time (typically within the last five minutes) will not be available.
        
        The rest of the options are incorrect because regardless of the database engine, 
        you cannot use a standby database for read and write operations.

          d: "EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2)",
        },
        correctAnswer: "b",
        explanation: `
        The scenario requires a storage type for a relational database with a high IOPS performance. 
        For these scenarios, SSD volumes are more suitable to use instead of HDD volumes. 
        Remember that the dominant performance attribute of SSD is IOPS while HDD is Throughput.

        In the exam, always consider the difference between SSD and HDD as shown on the table below. 
        This will allow you to easily eliminate specific EBS-types in the options which are not SSD or not HDD,
         depending on whether the question asks for a storage type which has small,
          random I/O operations or large, sequential I/O operations.
        
        Since the requirement is 30,000 IOPS, you have to use an EBS type of Provisioned IOPS SSD. 
        This provides sustained performance for mission-critical low-latency workloads.
         Hence, EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) is the correct answer.
        
        
        
        EBS Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) and EBS Cold HDD (sc1) are incorrect 
        because these are HDD volumes which are more suitable for large streaming 
        workloads rather than transactional database workloads.
        
        EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2) is incorrect because although a
         General Purpose SSD volume can be used for this scenario, 
         it does not provide the high IOPS required by the application,
          unlike the Provisioned IOPS SSD volume.

        correctAnswer: "b",
        explanation: `
       
SNI Custom SSL relies on the SNI extension of the Transport Layer Security protocol, 
which allows multiple domains to serve SSL traffic over the same IP address by 
including the hostname which the viewers are trying to connect to.

You can host multiple TLS secured applications, each with its own TLS certificate, 
behind a single load balancer. In order to use SNI, all you need to do is 
bind multiple certificates to the same secure listener on your load balancer.
 ALB will automatically choose the optimal TLS certificate for each client. 
 These features are provided at no additional charge.



To meet the requirements in the scenario, you can upload all SSL certificates 
of the domains in the ALB using the console and bind multiple certificates to 
the same secure listener on your load balancer. ALB will automatically choose 
the optimal TLS certificate for each client using Server Name Indication (SNI).

Hence, the correct answer is the option that says: Upload all SSL certificates of 
the domains in the ALB using the console and bind multiple certificates to the
 same secure listener on your load balancer. ALB will automatically choose the
  optimal TLS certificate for each client using Server Name Indication (SNI).

Using a wildcard certificate to handle multiple sub-domains and different domains 
is incorrect because a wildcard certificate can only handle multiple sub-domains but not different domains.

Adding a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) for each additional domain to your certificate 
is incorrect because although using SAN is correct, you will still have to reauthenticate and
 reprovision your certificate every time you add a new domain.
  One of the requirements in the scenario is that you should not have to 
  reauthenticate and reprovision your certificate hence, this solution is incorrect.

The option that says: Create a new CloudFront web distribution and configure it to 
serve HTTPS requests using dedicated IP addresses in order to associate your alternate
 domain names with a dedicated IP address in each CloudFront edge location is incorrect because 
 although it is valid to use dedicated IP addresses to meet this requirement,
  this solution is not cost-effective. Remember that if you configure CloudFront to 
  serve HTTPS requests using dedicated IP addresses, you incur an additional monthly charge. 
  The charge begins when you associate your SSL/TLS certificate with your CloudFront distribution. 
  You can just simply upload the certificates to the ALB and use SNI to handle multiple domains in 
  a cost-effective manner.

        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: `
        Basically, a database service in which you no longer need to worry about database management
         tasks such as hardware or software provisioning, setup, and configuration is called a fully 
         managed database. This means that AWS fully manages all of the database management tasks and 
         the underlying host server. The main differentiator here is the keyword "scaling" in the question. 
         In RDS, you still have to manually scale up your resources and create Read Replicas to improve
          scalability while in DynamoDB, this is automatically done.

        Amazon DynamoDB is the best option to use in this scenario.
         It is a fully managed non-relational database service â€“ you simply create a database table,
          set your target utilization for Auto Scaling, and let the service handle the rest.
           You no longer need to worry about database management tasks such as hardware or 
           software provisioning, setup, and configuration, software patching, operating a 
           reliable, distributed database cluster, or partitioning data over multiple instances as you scale. 
           DynamoDB also lets you backup and restore all your tables for data archival, 
           helping you meet your corporate and governmental regulatory requirements.
        
        Amazon RDS is incorrect because this is just a "managed" service and not "fully managed".

Reserved Instances provide you with a significant discount (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand instance pricing.
In addition, when Reserved Instances are assigned to a specific Availability Zone, 
they provide a capacity reservation,
giving you additional confidence in your ability to launch instances when you need them.

For applications that have steady state or predictable usage,
Reserved Instances can provide significant savings compared to using On-Demand instances.

Reserved Instances are recommended for:

- Applications with steady state usage

- Applications that may require reserved capacity

- Customers that can commit to using EC2 over a 1 or 3 year term to reduce their total computing costs

        correctAnswer: "c",
        explanation: `
        A bastion host is a server whose purpose is to provide access to a private 
        network from an external network, such as the Internet. Because of its exposure to potential attack,
         a bastion host must minimize the chances of penetration.

        To create a bastion host, you can create a new EC2 instance which should only
         have a security group from a particular IP address for maximum security.
          Since the cost is also considered in the question, you should choose a small instance for your host.
           By default, t2.micro instance is used by AWS but you can change these settings during deployment.
        
        Setting up a large EC2 instance and a security group which only 
        allows access on port 22 via your IP address is incorrect because you don't
         need to provision a large EC2 instance to run a single bastion host. 
         At the same time, you are looking for the cheapest solution possible.
        
        The options that say: Set up a large EC2 instance and a security group which 
        only allows access on port 22 and Set up a small EC2 instance and a security group 
        which only allows access on port 22 are both incorrect because you 
        did not set your specific IP address to the security group rules, 
        which possibly means that you publicly allow traffic from all sources in your security group.
         This is wrong as you should only be the one to have access to the bastion host.

        correctAnswer: "c",
        explanation: `
        Amazon S3 is storage for the Internet. 
        Itâ€™s a simple storage service that offers software developers a durable, 
        highly-scalable, reliable, and low-latency data storage infrastructure at very low costs. 
        Amazon S3 provides customers with a highly durable storage infrastructure. 
        Versioning offers an additional level of protection by providing a means 
        of recovery when customers accidentally overwrite or delete objects. 
        Remember that the scenario requires a durable storage for static content. 
        These two keywords are actually referring to S3, since it is highly durable and 
        suitable for storing static content.

        Hence, Amazon S3 is the correct answer.
    
Amazon EBS volume is incorrect because this is not as durable compared with S3.
 In addition, it is best to store the static contents in S3 rather than EBS.

Amazon EC2 instance store is incorrect because it is definitely not suitable - 
the data it holds will be wiped out immediately once the EC2 instance is restarted.

Amazon RDS instance is incorrect because an RDS instance is 
just a database and not suitable for storing static content. 
By default, RDS is not durable, unless you launch it to be in Multi-AZ deployments configuration.

        explanation: `
        Data protection refers to protecting data while in-transit (as it travels to and from Amazon S3) and
         at rest (while it is stored on disks in Amazon S3 data centers). 
        You can protect data in transit by using SSL or by using client-side encryption.
         You have the following options for protecting data at rest in Amazon S3.

        Use Server-Side Encryption â€“ You request Amazon S3 to encrypt your object before saving 
        it on disks in its data centers and decrypt it when you download the objects.
        
        Use Client-Side Encryption â€“ You can encrypt data client-side and upload the encrypted data to Amazon S3. 
        In this case, you manage the encryption process, the encryption keys, and related tools.

        Hence, the following options are the correct answers:

- Enable SSE on an S3 bucket to make use of AES-256 encryption

- Encrypt the data using your own encryption keys then copy the data to Amazon S3 over HTTPS endpoints.
 This refers to using a Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C).

Storing the data in encrypted EBS snapshots and storing the data on EBS volumes
 with encryption enabled instead of using Amazon S3 are both incorrect because
  all these options are for protecting your data in your EBS volumes. 
  Note that an S3 bucket does not use EBS volumes to store your data.

Using AWS Shield to protect your data at rest is incorrect because 
AWS Shield is mainly used to protect your entire VPC against DDoS attacks.

        },
        correctAnswer: "",
        explanation: `
        You are limited to running On-Demand Instances per your vCPU-based On-Demand Instance limit, 
        purchasing 20 Reserved Instances, and requesting Spot Instances per your dynamic Spot limit per region. 
        New AWS accounts may start with limits that are lower than the limits described here.


If you need more instances, complete the Amazon EC2 limit increase request form with your use case,
 and your limit increase will be considered. Limit increases are tied to the region they were requested for.

Hence, the correct answer is: There is a vCPU-based On-Demand Instance limit per region which 
is why subsequent requests failed. Just submit the limit increase form to AWS and retry the 
failed requests once approved.

The option that says: There was an issue with the Amazon EC2 API.
 Just resend the requests and these will be provisioned successfully is incorrect 
 because you are limited to running On-Demand Instances per your vCPU-based On-Demand Instance limit. 
 There is also a limit of purchasing 20 Reserved Instances, and 
 requesting Spot Instances per your dynamic Spot limit per region hence,
  there is no problem with the EC2 API.

The option that says: By default, AWS allows you to provision a maximum of 20 instances per region.
 Select a different region and retry the failed request is incorrect. 
 There is no need to select a different region since this limit
  can be increased after submitting a request form to AWS.

The option that says: By default, AWS allows you to provision 
a maximum of 20 instances per Availability Zone. 
Select a different Availability Zone and retry the 
failed request is incorrect because the vCPU-based On-Demand Instance 
limit is set per region and not per Availability Zone. 
This can be increased after submitting a request form to AWS.

          c: "Amazon Redshift with AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)",
          d: "Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK)",
        },
        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: `
Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is used to collect and process large streams of
data records in real-time. You can use Kinesis Data Streams
for rapid and continuous data intake and aggregation. 
The type of data used includes IT infrastructure log data, 
application logs, social media, market data feeds, and web clickstream data. 
Because the response time for the data intake and processing is in real-time, 
the processing is typically lightweight.

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of Kinesis Data Streams.
The producers continually push data to Kinesis Data Streams,
 and the consumers process the data in real-time. 
Consumers (such as a custom application running on Amazon EC2 or an 
Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream) can store their results using an AWS service
such as Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Redshift, or Amazon S3.


Hence, the correct answer is: Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.

Amazon S3 Access Points is incorrect because this is mainly used to manage access of your S3 objects.
 Amazon S3 access points are named network endpoints that are attached to buckets that you
  can use to perform S3 object operations, such as uploading and retrieving objects.

Amazon Redshift with AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is incorrect because 
this is mainly used for data warehousing making it simple and cost-effective to
 analyze your data across your data warehouse and data lake. Again, it does not meet 
 the requirement of being able to collect and process large streams of data in real-time. 
 Using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) with Amazon Redshift still won't satisfy this requirement.

Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) is incorrect.
 Although you can process streaming data in real-time with Amazon MSK,
  this service still entails a lot of administrative overhead, unlike Amazon Kinesis. 
  Moreover, it doesn't have a built-in enhanced fan-out feature as required in the scenario.

        explanation: `
        When the word durability pops out, the first service that should come to your mind is Amazon S3. 
        Since this service is not available in the answer options,
         we can look at the other data store available which is Amazon DynamoDB.

         DynamoDB is durable, scalable, and highly available data store which can be used for real-time tabulation.
          You can also use AppSync with DynamoDB to make it easy for you to build 
          collaborative apps that keep shared data updated in real time.
           You just specify the data for your app with simple code statements and 
           AWS AppSync manages everything needed to keep the app data updated in real time. 
           This will allow your app to access data in Amazon DynamoDB, 
           trigger AWS Lambda functions, or run Amazon Elasticsearch queries and
            combine data from these services to provide the exact data you need for your app.

         Amazon Redshift and AWS Mobile Hub are incorrect as Amazon Redshift is mainly 
         used as a data warehouse and for online analytic processing (OLAP). 
         Although this service can be used for this scenario, 
         DynamoDB is still the top choice given its better durability and scalability.
         
         Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) and Amazon MQ and Amazon Aurora and Amazon 
         Cognito are possible answers in this scenario, however,
          DynamoDB is much more suitable for simple mobile apps that do 
          not have complicated data relationships compared with enterprise web applications. 
          It is stated in the scenario that the mobile app will be used from around the world,
           which is why you need a data storage service which can be supported globally. 
           It would be a management overhead to implement multi-region deployment 
           for your RDS and Aurora database instances compared to using the Global table feature of DynamoDB.

        },
        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: `
        A VPC spans all the Availability Zones in the region. 
        After creating a VPC, you can add one or more subnets in each Availability Zone.
         When you create a subnet, you specify the CIDR block for the subnet, 
         which is a subset of the VPC CIDR block. Each subnet must reside entirely 
         within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones.
          Availability Zones are distinct locations that are engineered to be 
          isolated from failures in other Availability Zones. 
          By launching instances in separate Availability Zones, 
          you can protect your applications from the failure of a single location.

          Each subnet maps to a single Availability Zone.

          - Every subnet that you create is automatically associated with the main route table for the VPC.
          
          - If a subnet's traffic is routed to an Internet gateway, the subnet is known as a public subnet.
          
          The option that says: EC2 instances in a private subnet can communicate with 
          the Internet only if they have an Elastic IP is incorrect because EC2 instances 
          in a private subnet can communicate with the Internet not just by having an Elastic IP, 
          but also with a public IP address via a NAT Instance or a NAT Gateway. 
          Take note that there is a distinction between private and public IP addresses. 
          To enable communication with the Internet, a public IPv4 address is 
          mapped to the primary private IPv4 address through network address translation (NAT).
          
          The option that says: The allowed block size in VPC is 
          between a /16 netmask (65,536 IP addresses) and /27 netmask (16 IP addresses) 
          is incorrect because the allowed block 
          size in VPC is between a /16 netmask (65,536 IP addresses) and /28 
          netmask (16 IP addresses) and not /27 netmask. 
          For you to easily remember this, /27 netmask is 
          equivalent to exactly 27 IP addresses but keep in mind that the limit is until /28 netmask.
          
          The option that says: Each subnet spans to 2 Availability Zones is incorrect 
          because each subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones.

        },
        correctAnswer: "c",
        explanation: `
        Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) is a massively scalable and durable real-time data streaming service.
         KDS can continuously capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources. 
         You can use an AWS Lambda function to process records in Amazon KDS. 
         By default, Lambda invokes your function as soon as records
          are available in the stream. Lambda can process up to 10 batches in each shard simultaneously. 
          If you increase the number of 
        concurrent batches per shard, Lambda still ensures in-order processing at the partition-key level.
    
        The first time you invoke your function, AWS Lambda creates an instance of the 
        function and runs its handler method to process the event. When the function returns a response,
         it stays active and waits to process additional events. 
         If you invoke the function again while the first event is being processed, 
         Lambda initializes another instance, and the function processes the two events concurrently. 
         As more events come in, Lambda routes them to available instances and creates new instances as needed.
          When the number of requests decreases, Lambda stops unused instances 
          to free upscaling capacity for other functions.

        Since the media company needs a real-time analytics service, 
        you can use Kinesis Data Streams to gain insights from your data. 
        The data collected is available in milliseconds. 
        Use AWS Lambda to read records in batches and invoke your function to process records from the batch. 
        If the batch that Lambda reads from the stream only has one record in it,
         Lambda sends only one record to the function.
        
        Hence, the correct answer in this scenario is: 
        Create a Kinesis Data Stream and use AWS Lambda to read records from the data stream.
        
        The option that says: Create a Kinesis Data Firehose and use
         AWS Lambda to read records from the data stream is incorrect. 
         Although Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose captures and loads data in near real-time,
          AWS Lambda can't be set as its destination. 
          You can write Lambda functions and integrate it with Kinesis Data Firehose to request additional,
           customized processing of the data before it is sent downstream. 
           However, this integration is primarily used for
            stream processing and not the actual consumption of the data stream. 
            You have to use a Kinesis Data Stream in this scenario.
        
        The options that say: Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store the captured 
        data and use Amazon Athena to analyze the data and Create 
        an Amazon S3 bucket to store the captured data and use Amazon Redshift 
        Spectrum to analyze the data are both incorrect. 
        As per the scenario, the company needs a real-time analytics service that can ingest and process data. 
        You need to use Amazon Kinesis to process the data in real-time.

        The correct answers are:

        - The total volume of data and number of objects you can store are unlimited.
        
        - The largest object that can be uploaded in a single PUT is 5 GB.
        
        
        The option that says: The largest object that can be uploaded in
         a single PUT is 5 TB is incorrect as the largest object that can 
         be uploaded in a single PUT is 5 GB and not 5 TB.
          Remember that the upload limit depends on whether
           you upload an object using a single PUT operation or via Multipart Upload. 
           The largest object that can be uploaded in a single PUT is 5 GB. 
           Please take note the phrase "... in a single PUT". 
           If you are using the multipart upload API, then the limit is 5 TB.
        
        The option that says: S3 is an object storage service that provides 
        file system access semantics (such as strong consistency and file locking),

        is indeed an object storage service, it does not provide file system access semantics. 
        EFS provides this feature but not S3.
        
        The option that says: You can only store ZIP or

        The Reserved Instance Marketplace is a platform that supports the sale of 
        third-party and AWS customers' unused Standard Reserved Instances, 
        which vary in terms of lengths and pricing options. For example,

         changing to a new instance type, ending projects before the term expiration, 
         when your business needs change, or if you have unneeded capacity.

         Hence, the correct answers are:

- Go to the AWS Reserved Instance Marketplace and sell the Reserved instances.

- Terminate the Reserved instances as soon as possible to avoid getting billed at the on-demand price 
when it expires.

Stopping the Reserved instances as soon as possible is incorrect because a stopped instance can still be restarted.
 Take note that when a Reserved Instance expires, any instances that were covered by the Reserved Instance 
 are billed at the on-demand price which costs significantly higher. 
 Since the application is already decommissioned, there is no point of keeping the unused instances.
It is also possible that there are associated Elastic IP addresses,
which will incur charges if they are associated with stopped instances

Contacting AWS to cancel your AWS subscription is incorrect as you don't need to close down your AWS account.

Going to the Amazon.com online shopping website and selling the 
Reserved instances is incorrect as you have to use AWS Reserved Instance Marketplace to sell your instances.

        What service must be used to easily capture, transform, and 
        load streaming data into Amazon S3, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and Splunk?

        answers: {
          a: "Amazon SQS ",
          b: "Amazon Redshift",
          c: "Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.",
          d: "Amazon Kinesis",
        },
        correctAnswer: "c",
        explanation: `
        Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is the easiest way to load streaming data into data stores 
        and analytics tools. It can capture, transform, and load streaming data into Amazon S3,
         Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and Splunk,
          enabling near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools and 
          dashboards you are already using today.

        It is a fully managed service that automatically scales to match the throughput
         of your data and requires no ongoing administration. It can also batch, compress, 
         and encrypt the data before loading it, minimizing the amount of storage used at 
         the destination and increasing security.
        
        In the diagram below, you gather the data from your smart refrigerators and 
        use Kinesis Data firehouse to prepare and load the data. 
        S3 will be used as a method of durably storing the data for 
        analytics and the eventual ingestion of data for output using analytical tools.
        
        You can use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose in conjunction with Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
         if you need to implement real-time processing of streaming big data. 
         Kinesis Data Streams provides an ordering of records, 
         as well as the ability to read and/or replay records in the same order 
         to multiple Amazon Kinesis Applications. 
         The Amazon Kinesis Client Library (KCL) delivers all records for 
         a given partition key to the same record processor,
          making it easier to build multiple applications reading 
          from the same Amazon Kinesis data stream (for example, to perform counting, aggregation, and filtering).

        Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) is different from Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.
         SQS offers a reliable, highly scalable hosted queue for storing messages
          as they travel between computers.
           Amazon SQS lets you easily move data between distributed application 
           components and helps you build applications in which messages 
           are processed independently (with message-level ack/fail semantics), 
           such as automated workflows. Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is primarily used to load 
           streaming data into data stores and analytics tools.
        
        Hence, the correct answer is: Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.
        
        Amazon Kinesis is incorrect because this is the streaming data platform of AWS and 
        has four distinct services under it: Kinesis Data Firehose, Kinesis Data Streams, 
        Kinesis Video Streams, and Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics.
         For the specific use case just as asked in the scenario, use Kinesis Data Firehose.
        
        Amazon Redshift is incorrect because this is mainly used for data 
        warehousing making it simple and cost-effective to analyze your data
         across your data warehouse and data lake. It does not meet the requirement
          of being able to load and stream data into data stores for analytics. 
          You have to use Kinesis Data Firehose instead.
        
        Amazon SQS is incorrect because you can't capture, transform, and 
        load streaming data into Amazon S3, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, 
        and Splunk using this service. You have to use Kinesis Data Firehose instead.

          `,
        },
        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: `
        You can associate the CreationPolicy attribute with a resource to prevent its status
         from reaching create complete until AWS CloudFormation receives a 
         specified number of success signals or the timeout period is exceeded.
         To signal a resource, you can use the cfn-signal helper script or SignalResource API.
          AWS CloudFormation publishes valid signals to the stack events
           so that you track the number of signals sent.

        The creation policy is invoked only when AWS CloudFormation creates the associated resource.
         Currently, the only AWS CloudFormation resources that support
          creation policies are AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup, AWS::EC2::Instance,
           and AWS::CloudFormation::WaitCondition.
    
           Use the CreationPolicy attribute when you want to wait on resource 
           configuration actions before stack creation proceeds. For example, 
           if you install and configure software applications on an EC2 instance,
            you might want those applications to be running before proceeding. 
            In such cases, you can add a CreationPolicy attribute to the instance, 
            and then send a success signal to the instance after the applications are installed and configured.

           Hence, the option that says: Configure a CreationPolicy attribute to the 
           instance in the CloudFormation template. Send a success signal after the 
           applications are installed and configured using the cfn-signal helper script is correct.
           
           The option that says: Configure the DependsOn attribute in the CloudFormation template. 
           Send a success signal after the applications are installed and 
           configured using the cfn-init helper script is incorrect 
           because the cfn-init helper script is not suitable to be used to signal another resource.
            You have to use cfn-signal instead. And although you can use the DependsOn 
            attribute to ensure the creation of a specific resource follows another,
             it is still better to use the CreationPolicy attribute instead as it
              ensures that the applications are properly running before the stack creation proceeds.
           
           The option that says: Configure a UpdatePolicy attribute to the
            instance in the CloudFormation template. Send a success signal after
             the applications are installed and configured using the cfn-signal helper
              script is incorrect because the UpdatePolicy attribute is primarily 
              used for updating resources and for stack update rollback operations.
           
           The option that says: Configure the UpdateReplacePolicy attribute in the CloudFormation template. 
           Send a success signal after the applications are installed and configured 
           using the cfn-signal helper script is incorrect because the UpdateReplacePolicy 
           attribute is primarily used to retain or in some cases, back up the existing 
           physical instance of a resource when it is replaced during a stack update operation.

          d: "The attached IAM execution role of your function does not have the necessary permissions to access the resources of your VPC",
        },
        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: `
        You can configure a function to connect to a virtual private cloud (VPC) in your account.
         Use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to create a private network for resources such as databases,
          cache instances, or internal services. Connect your function 
          to the VPC to access private resources during execution.

        AWS Lambda runs your function code securely within a VPC by default. 
        However, to enable your Lambda function to access resources inside your private VPC, 
        you must provide additional VPC-specific configuration information
         that includes VPC subnet IDs and security group IDs.
          AWS Lambda uses this information to set up
           elastic network interfaces (ENIs) that enable your function to connect securely 
           to other resources within your private VPC.
        
        Lambda functions cannot connect directly to a VPC with dedicated instance tenancy. 
        To connect to resources in a dedicated VPC, peer it to a second VPC with default tenancy.
        
        Your Lambda function automatically scales based on the number of events it processes. 
        If your Lambda function accesses a VPC, you must make sure 
        that your VPC has sufficient ENI capacity to support the scale requirements of your Lambda function.
         It is also recommended that you specify at least one subnet 
         in each Availability Zone in your Lambda function configuration.
        
        By specifying subnets in each of the Availability Zones,
         your Lambda function can run in another Availability Zone if one goes down or runs out of IP addresses.
          If your VPC does not have sufficient ENIs or subnet IPs, 
          your Lambda function will not scale as requests increase, 
          and you will see an increase in invocation errors with EC2 error types like EC2ThrottledException. 
          For asynchronous invocation, if you see an increase in errors without corresponding CloudWatch Logs, 
          invoke the Lambda function synchronously in the console to get the error responses.
        
        Hence, the correct answers for this scenario are:
        
        - You only specified one subnet in your Lambda function configuration. 
        That single subnet runs out of available IP addresses and 
        there is no other subnet or Availability Zone which can handle the peak load.
        
        - Your VPC does not have sufficient subnet ENIs or subnet IPs.

 the hostname and port that you specify point to an intermediate handler called an endpoint.
  Aurora uses the endpoint mechanism to abstract these connections. 
  Thus, you don't have to hardcode all the hostnames or write your own 
  logic for load-balancing and rerouting connections when some DB instances aren't available.

For certain Aurora tasks, different instances or groups of instances perform different roles.
 For example, the primary instance handles all data definition 
 language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML) statements. 
 Up to 15 Aurora Replicas handle read-only query traffic.

Using endpoints, you can map each connection to the appropriate 
instance or group of instances based on your use case. For example,
 to perform DDL statements you can connect to whichever instance is the primary instance.
  To perform queries, you can connect to the reader endpoint, 
  with Aurora automatically performing load-balancing among all the Aurora Replicas. 
  For clusters with DB instances of different capacities or configurations,
   you can connect to custom endpoints associated with different subsets of DB instances. 
   For diagnosis or tuning, you can connect to a specific instance 
   endpoint to examine details about a specific DB instance.



A reader endpoint for an Aurora DB cluster provides load-balancing 
support for read-only connections to the DB cluster. Use the reader endpoint for read operations, such as queries.
 By processing those statements on the read-only Aurora Replicas, 
 this endpoint reduces the overhead on the primary instance. 
 It also helps the cluster to scale the capacity to handle simultaneous SELECT queries, 
 proportional to the number of Aurora Replicas in the cluster.
  Each Aurora DB cluster has one reader endpoint.

If the cluster contains one or more Aurora Replicas, 
the reader endpoint load-balances each connection request among the Aurora Replicas. 
In that case, you can only perform read-only statements such as SELECT in that session. 
If the cluster only contains a primary instance and no Aurora Replicas, 
the reader endpoint connects to the primary instance. 
In that case, you can perform write operations through the endpoint.

Hence, the correct answer is to use the built-in Reader endpoint of the Amazon Aurora database.

The option that says: Use the built-in Cluster endpoint of the
 Amazon Aurora database is incorrect because a 
 cluster endpoint (also known as a writer endpoint) simply connects 
 to the current primary DB instance for that DB cluster. 
 This endpoint can perform write operations in the database such as DDL statements, 
 which is perfect for handling production traffic but not suitable 
 for handling queries for reporting since there will be no write database operations that will be sent.

The option that says: Enable Amazon Aurora Parallel Query is incorrect because
 this feature simply enables Amazon Aurora to push down and distribute 
 the computational load of a single query across thousands of CPUs in Aurora's storage layer. 
 Take note that it does not load balance all of the incoming read requests equally to the two Read Replicas. 
 With Parallel Query, query processing is pushed down to the Aurora storage layer. 
 The query gains a large amount of computing power, and 
 it needs to transfer far less data over the network. 
 In the meantime, the Aurora database instance can continue 
 serving transactions with much less interruption. 
 This way, you can run transactional and analytical workloads alongside 
 each other in the same Aurora database, while maintaining high performance.

The option that says: Create a new Network Load Balancer to evenly distribute the 
read queries to the Read Replicas of the Amazon Aurora database is incorrect because 
a Network Load Balancer is not the suitable service/component to 
use for this requirement since an NLB is primarily used to distribute traffic to servers, not Read Replicas. 
You have to use the built-in Reader endpoint of the Amazon Aurora database instead.

     Currently, all of their clients can access their S3 buckets directly using

          Remove permission to use Amazon S3 URLs to read the files for anyone else`,
        },
        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: `
        Many companies that distribute content over the Internet want to restrict access to documents, 
        business data, media streams, or content that is intended for selected users, for example, 
        users who have paid a fee. To securely serve this private content by using CloudFront, 
        you can do the following:

        - Require that your users access your private content by using special 
        CloudFront signed URLs or signed cookies.
        
        - Require that your users access your Amazon S3 content by using CloudFront URLs, 
        not Amazon S3 URLs. Requiring CloudFront URLs isn't necessary, 
        but it is recommended to prevent users from bypassing the restrictions that 
        you specify in signed URLs or signed cookies. 
        You can do this by setting up an origin access identity (OAI) for your Amazon S3 bucket. 
        You can also configure the custom headers for a private HTTP server or
         an Amazon S3 bucket configured as a website endpoint.
        
        All objects and buckets by default are private. 
        The pre-signed URLs are useful if you want your user/customer to be able 
        to upload a specific object to your bucket, but you don't require them to have
         AWS security credentials or permissions. You can generate 
         a pre-signed URL programmatically using the AWS SDK for Java or 
         the AWS SDK for .NET. If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio, 
         you can also use AWS Explorer to generate a pre-signed object URL without writing any code. 
         Anyone who receives a valid pre-signed URL can then programmatically upload an object.
        

         Hence, the correct answers are:

         - Restrict access to files in the origin by creating an origin access identity (OAI) and 
         give it permission to read the files in the bucket.
         
         - Require the users to access the private content by using special CloudFront signed URLs or 
         signed cookies.
         
         The option that says: Use AWS App Mesh to ensure that only their client
          can access the files is incorrect because AWS App Mesh is just a service
           mesh that provides application-level networking to make it easy for your 
           services to communicate with each other across multiple types of compute infrastructure.
         
         The option that says: Use AWS Cloud Map to ensure that only their client can access 
         the files is incorrect because AWS Cloud Map is simply a cloud resource discovery 
         service that enables you to name your application resources with custom names and
          automatically update the locations of your dynamically changing resources.
         
         The option that says: Use S3 pre-signed URLs to ensure that only their client can access the files.
          Remove permission to use Amazon S3 URLs to read the files for anyone else is incorrect.
           Although this could be a valid solution, it doesn't satisfy the requirement 
           to serve the private content via CloudFront only to secure the distribution of files. 
           A better solution is to set up an origin access identity (OAI) then use Signed URL or
            Signed Cookies in your CloudFront web distribution.

        },
        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: `
        AWS Backup is a centralized backup service that makes it easy and 
        cost-effective for you to backup your application data across AWS services in the AWS Cloud,
         helping you meet your business and regulatory backup compliance requirements.
          AWS Backup makes protecting your AWS storage volumes, databases,
           and file systems simple by providing a central place where you can 
           configure and audit the AWS resources you want to backup, 
           automate backup scheduling, set retention policies, 
        and monitor all recent backup and restore activity.

In this scenario, you can use AWS Backup to create a backup plan with a retention period of 90 days.
 A backup plan is a policy expression that defines when and how you want to back up your AWS resources.
  You assign resources to backup plans, and 
  AWS Backup then automatically backs up and 
  retains backups for those resources according to the backup plan.

Hence, the correct answer is: Create an AWS Backup plan to take daily 
snapshots with a retention period of 90 days.

The option that says: Configure an automated backup and 
set the backup retention period to 90 days is incorrect because 
the maximum backup retention period for automated backup is only 35 days.

The option that says: Configure RDS to export the automated snapshot automatically 
to Amazon S3 and create a lifecycle policy to delete the object 
after 90 days is incorrect because you can't export an automated snapshot automatically to Amazon S3. 
You must export the snapshot manually.

The option that says: Create a daily scheduled event using CloudWatch Events and 
AWS Lambda to directly download the RDS automated snapshot to an S3 bucket. 
Archive snapshots older than 90 days to Glacier is incorrect because you cannot 
directly download or export an automated snapshot in RDS to Amazon S3. 
You have to copy the automated snapshot first for it to become a manual snapshot, 
which you can move to an Amazon S3 bucket. A better solution for this scenario is to simply use AWS Backup.

          d: "You will not be billed for any instance usage while an instance is not in the running state",
        },
        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: `
        By working with Amazon EC2 to manage your instances from the moment you 
        launch them through their termination, you ensure that your customers have
         the best possible experience with the applications or sites that you host on your instances. 
         The following illustration represents the transitions between instance states.
          Notice that you can't stop and start an instance store-backed instance:

        Below are the valid EC2 lifecycle instance states:
        
        pending - The instance is preparing to enter the running state.
         An instance enters the pending state when it launches for the first time,
          or when it is restarted after being in the stopped state.
        
        running - The instance is running and ready for use.
        
        stopping - The instance is preparing to be stopped. 
        Take note that you will not billed if it is preparing to stop however, 
        you will still be billed if it is just preparing to hibernate.
        
        stopped - The instance is shut down and cannot be used. 
        The instance can be restarted at any time.
        
        shutting-down - The instance is preparing to be terminated.
        
        terminated - The instance has been permanently deleted and cannot be restarted. 
        Take note that Reserved Instances that applied to terminated instances are still billed until 
        the end of their term according to their payment option.
        
        The option that says: You will be billed when your On-Demand instance is preparing
         to hibernate with a stopping state is correct because when the instance state is stopping, 
         you will not billed if it is preparing to stop however, 
         you will still be billed if it is just preparing to hibernate.
        
        The option that says: You will be billed when your Reserved instance is 
        in terminated state is correct because 
        Reserved Instances that applied to terminated instances are
         still billed until the end of their term according to their payment option.
          I actually raised a pull-request to Amazon team about the billing conditions 
          for Reserved Instances, which has been approved and reflected on your official AWS Documentation:
           https://github.com/awsdocs/amazon-ec2-user-guide/pull/45
        
        The option that says: You will be billed when your On-Demand instance
         is in pending state is incorrect because you will not be billed if your instance is in pending state.
        
        The option that says: You will be billed when your Spot instance 
        is preparing to stop with a stopping state is incorrect because
         you will not be billed if your instance is preparing to stop with a stopping state.
        
        The option that says: You will not be billed for any instance usage while
         an instance is not in the running state is incorrect because the statement is not entirely true.
          You can still be billed if your instance is preparing to hibernate with a stopping state.

 This application has a large backlog of videos which need to be transcoded. 
 Your manager would like to reduce this backlog by adding more EC2 instances,
  however, these instances are only needed until the backlog is reduced.

In this scenario, which type of Amazon EC2 instance is the most cost-effective type to use?

          a: "Reserved instances",
          b: "Dedicated instances",
          c: "On-demand instances ",
          d: "Spot instances ",
        },
        correctAnswer: "d",
        explanation: `
You require an instance that will be used not as a primary server but as a spare compute 
resource to augment the transcoding process of your application. 
These instances should also be terminated once the backlog has been significantly reduced.
In addition, the scenario mentions that if the current process is interrupted, 
the video can be transcoded by another instance based on the queuing system.
This means that the application can gracefully handle an unexpected termination of an EC2 instance, 
like in the event of a Spot instance termination when the Spot price is greater than your set maximum price.
Hence, an Amazon EC2 Spot instance is the best and cost-effective option for this scenario.

Amazon EC2 Spot instances are spare compute capacity in 
the AWS cloud available to you at steep discounts compared to On-Demand prices.
EC2 Spot enables you to optimize your costs on the AWS cloud and 
scale your application's throughput up to 10X for the same budget. 
By simply selecting Spot when launching EC2 instances,
you can save up-to 90% on On-Demand prices.
The only difference between On-Demand instances and 
Spot Instances is that Spot instances can be interrupted 
by EC2 with two minutes of notification when the EC2 needs the capacity back. 

You can specify whether Amazon EC2 should hibernate, stop,
 or terminate Spot Instances when they are interrupted. 
 You can choose the interruption behavior that meets your needs.

Take note that there is no "bid price" anymore for Spot EC2 instances since March 2018.
 You simply have to set your maximum price instead.

Reserved instances and Dedicated instances are incorrect as both do not act as spare compute capacity.

On-demand instances is a valid option but a Spot instance is much cheaper than On-Demand.

          `,
          d: `
          Enable the Requester Pays feature in the source S3 bucket.

          `,
        },
        correctAnswer: "c",
        explanation: `
        By default, an S3 object is owned by the account that uploaded the object. 
        That's why granting the destination account the permissions to 
        perform the cross-account copy makes sure that the destination owns the copied objects.
         You can also change the ownership of an object by changing its 
         access control list (ACL) to bucket-owner-full-control.

        However, object ACLs can be difficult to manage for multiple objects, 
        so it's a best practice to grant programmatic cross-account permissions to the destination account.
         Object ownership is important for managing permissions using a bucket policy. 
         For a bucket policy to apply to an object in the bucket, 
         the object must be owned by the account that owns the bucket. 
         You can also manage object permissions using the object's ACL. 
         However, object ACLs can be difficult to manage for multiple objects,
         so it's best practice to use the bucket policy as a centralized method for setting permissions.

         To be sure that a destination account owns an S3 object 
         copied from another account, grant the destination account 
         the permissions to perform the cross-account copy. 
         Follow these steps to configure cross-account
          permissions to copy objects from a source bucket in Account A to a destination bucket in Account B:

- Attach a bucket policy to the source bucket in Account A.

- Attach an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy to a user or role in Account B.

- Use the IAM user or role in Account B to perform the cross-account copy.

Hence, the correct answer is: Configure cross-account permissions in 
S3 by creating an IAM customer-managed policy that allows an IAM user or
 role to copy objects from the source bucket in one account to the destination bucket in the other account. 
 Then attach the policy to the IAM user or role that you want to use to copy objects between accounts.

The option that says: Enable the Requester Pays feature in the source S3 bucket. 
The fees would be waived through Consolidated Billing since 
both AWS accounts are part of AWS Organizations is incorrect
 because the Requester Pays feature is primarily used if you want the requester,
  instead of the bucket owner, to pay the cost of the data transfer request and download from the S3 bucket. 
  This solution lacks the necessary IAM Permissions to satisfy the requirement. 
  The most suitable solution here is to configure cross-account permissions in S3.

The option that says: Set up cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) 
in S3 by creating a bucket policy that allows an IAM user or role 
to copy objects from the source bucket in one account to the destination 
bucket in the other account is incorrect because CORS simply defines 
a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to 
interact with resources in a different domain, and not on a different AWS account.

The option that says: Connect the two S3 buckets from two different AWS accounts to Amazon WorkDocs. 
Set up cross-account access to integrate the two S3 buckets. 
Use the Amazon WorkDocs console to copy the objects from one 
account to the other with modified object ownership assigned to 
the destination account is incorrect because 
Amazon WorkDocs is commonly used to easily collaborate,
 share content, provide rich feedback, and collaboratively edit documents with other users. 
 There is no direct way for you to integrate WorkDocs and an Amazon S3 bucket owned by a different AWS account. 
 A better solution here is to use cross-account permissions in S3 to meet the requirement.

          d: "It enhances the read performance of your primary database by increasing its IOPS and accelerates its query processing via AWS Global Accelerator",
        },
        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: `
        Amazon RDS Read Replicas provide enhanced performance and durability for database (DB) instances.
         This feature makes it easy to elastically scale out beyond 
         the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads.

        You can create one or more replicas of a given source DB Instance and
         serve high-volume application read traffic from multiple copies of your data,
          thereby increasing aggregate read throughput. Read replicas can 
          also be promoted when needed to become standalone DB instances.
        
        For the MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle database engines, 
        Amazon RDS creates a second DB instance using a snapshot of the source DB instance. 
        It then uses the engines' native asynchronous replication to update 
        the read replica whenever there is a change to the source DB instance.
         The read replica operates as a DB instance that allows only read-only connections; 
         applications can connect to a read replica just as they would to any DB instance.
         Amazon RDS replicates all databases in the source DB instance.

         When you create a read replica for Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, Amazon RDS sets up a secure communications channel using public-key encryption between the source DB instance and the read replica, even when replicating across regions. Amazon RDS establishes any AWS security configurations such as adding security group entries needed to enable the secure channel.

You can also create read replicas within a Region or between Regions for your Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle database instances encrypted at rest with AWS Key Management Service (KMS).

Hence, the correct answers are:

- It elastically scales out beyond the capacity constraints of a 
single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads.

- Provides asynchronous replication and improves the performance of the 
primary database by taking read-heavy database workloads from it.

The option that says: Allows both read and write operations on the read replica
 to complement the primary database is incorrect as Read Replicas are 
 primarily used to offload read-only operations from the primary database instance. 
 By default, you can't do a write operation to your Read Replica.

The option that says: Provides synchronous replication and automatic failover 
in the case of Availability Zone service failures is incorrect as this is a

benefit of Multi-AZ and not of a Read Replica. Moreover, 
Read Replicas provide an asynchronous type of replication and not synchronous replication.

The option that says: It enhances the read performance of your
 primary database by increasing its IOPS and accelerates 
 its query processing via AWS Global Accelerator is incorrect because 
 Read Replicas do not do anything to upgrade or 
 increase the read throughput on the primary DB instance per se, 
 but it provides a way for your application to fetch data from replicas. 
 In this way, it improves the overall performance of your
  entire database-tier (and not just the primary DB instance).
  It doesn't increase the IOPS nor use AWS Global Accelerator to 
  accelerate the compute capacity of your primary database. 
  AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service, not related to RDS, 
  that direct user traffic to the nearest application endpoint to the client, 
  thus reducing internet latency and jitter. It simply routes the traffic 
  to the closest edge location via Anycast.

        question: `
        A tech company is currently using Auto Scaling for their web application.
        A new AMI now needs to be used for launching a fleet of EC2 instances.

        Which of the following changes needs to be done?   
     `,
        answers: {
          a: `
          Do nothing. You can start directly launching EC2 instances in the Auto Scaling group 
          with the same launch configuration
          `,
          b: "create a new target group ",
          c: "create a new target group and launch configuration",
          d: "Create a new launch configuration.",
        },
        correctAnswer: "d",
        explanation: `

        A launch configuration is a template that an Auto Scaling group uses to launch EC2 instances.
         When you create a launch configuration, you specify information for the instances 
         such as the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, 
         one or more security groups, and a block device mapping. If you've launched an EC2 instance before, 
        you specified the same information in order to launch the instance.
        You can specify your launch configuration with multiple Auto Scaling groups. 
        However, you can only specify one launch configuration for an Auto Scaling group at a time,
         and you can't modify a launch configuration after you've created it. 
         Therefore, if you want to change the launch configuration for an Auto Scaling group,
          you must create a launch configuration and then update your 
          Auto Scaling group with the new launch configuration.

        For this scenario, you have to create a new launch configuration.
         Remember that you can't modify a launch configuration after you've created it.
        
        Hence, the correct answer is: Create a new launch configuration.
        
        The option that says: Do nothing. You can start directly launching EC2 instances 
        in the Auto Scaling group with the same launch configuration is
         incorrect because what you are trying to achieve is change 
         the AMI being used by your fleet of EC2 instances.
          Therefore, you need to change the launch configuration to update what your instances are using.
        
        The option that says: create a new target group and create 
        a new target group and launch configuration are both incorrect 
        because you only want to change the AMI being used by your instances,
         and not the instances themselves. 
         Target groups are primarily used in ELBs and not in Auto Scaling. 
         The scenario didn't mention that the architecture has a load balancer. 
         Therefore, you should be updating your launch configuration, not the target group.

        },
        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: `
        To enable the connection to a service running on an instance, 
        the associated network ACL must allow both inbound traffic on 
        the port that the service is listening on as well as allow outbound traffic from ephemeral ports. 
        When a client connects to a server, a random port from the ephemeral port range (1024-65535) becomes 
        the client's source port.

        The designated ephemeral port then becomes the destination port for return traffic from the service, 
        so outbound traffic from the ephemeral port must be allowed in the network ACL.
         By default, network ACLs allow all inbound and outbound traffic.
          If your network ACL is more restrictive, then you need to explicitly allow traffic
           from the ephemeral port range.
           The client that initiates the request chooses the ephemeral port range. The range varies depending on the client's operating system.

           - Many Linux kernels (including the Amazon Linux kernel) use ports 32768-61000.
           
           - Requests originating from Elastic Load Balancing use ports 1024-65535.
           
           - Windows operating systems through Windows Server 2003 use ports 1025-5000.
           
           - Windows Server 2008 and later versions use ports 49152-65535.
           
           - A NAT gateway uses ports 1024-65535.
           
           - AWS Lambda functions use ports 1024-65535.
           
           For example, if a request comes into a web server in your VPC from 
           a Windows 10 client on the Internet, your network ACL must have an 
           outbound rule to enable traffic destined for ports 49152 - 65535. 
           If an instance in your VPC is the client initiating a request, 
           your network ACL must have an inbound rule to enable traffic destined for 
           the ephemeral ports specific to the type of instance (Amazon Linux, Windows Server 2008, and so on).
           
           In this scenario, you only need to allow the incoming traffic on port 443. 
           Since security groups are stateful, you can apply any changes to an 
           incoming rule and it will be automatically applied to the outgoing rule.
           
           To enable the connection to a service running on an instance, 
           the associated network ACL must allow both inbound traffic on the port 
           that the service is listening on as well as allow outbound traffic from ephemeral ports. 
           When a client connects to a server, a random port from the ephemeral 
           port range (32768 - 65535) becomes the client's source port.
           
           Hence, the correct answers are:
           
           - In the Security Group, add a new rule to allow TCP connection on port 443 from source 0.0.0.0/0.
           
           - In the Network ACL, update the rule to allow inbound TCP 
           connection on port 443 from source 0.0.0.0/0 and outbound TCP connection 
           on port 32768 - 65535 to destination 0.0.0.0/0.
           
           The option that says: In the Security Group, 
           create a new rule to allow TCP connection 
           on port 443 to destination 0.0.0.0/0 is incorrect because this step just allows outbound connections
            from the EC2 instance out to the public Internet which is unnecessary. 
            Remember that a default security group already includes an outbound rule 
            that allows all outbound traffic.
           
           The option that says: In the Network ACL, update the rule to 
           allow both inbound and outbound TCP 
           connection on port 443 from source 0.0.0.0/0 and to destination 0.0.0.0/0 is incorrect because 
           your network ACL must have an outbound rule to allow ephemeral ports (32768 - 65535). 
           These are the specific ports that will be used as the client's source port for the traffic response.
           
           The option that says: In the Network ACL, 
           update the rule to allow outbound TCP connection on port 32768 - 65535 to destination 0.0.0.0/0 is 
           incorrect because this step is just partially right. You still need to add an
            inbound rule from port 443 and not just the outbound rule for the ephemeral ports (32768 - 65535).

        explanation: `
        Amazon Redshift is a fast, scalable data warehouse that makes
         it simple and cost-effective to analyze all your data across your data warehouse and data lake.
          Redshift delivers ten times faster performance than other data warehouses by using machine learning,
           massively parallel query execution, and columnar storage on high-performance disk.

        In this scenario, there is a requirement to have a storage service that will be
         used by a business intelligence application and where the data must be stored in a columnar fashion.
          Business Intelligence reporting systems are a type 
          of Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) which Redshift is known to support. 
          In addition, Redshift also provides columnar storage, unlike the other options.
        
        Hence, the correct answer in this scenario is Amazon Redshift.

        A bastion host is a special purpose computer on a network specifically designed and 
        configured to withstand attacks. The computer generally hosts a single application,
        for example a proxy server, and all other services are removed or 
        limited to reduce the threat to the computer.

        When setting up a bastion host in AWS, you should only allow the individual IP of the client 
        and not the entire network. Therefore, in the Source, the proper CIDR notation should be used.
         The /32 denotes one IP address and the /0 refers to the entire network.
        
        The option that says: Security Group Inbound Rule:
         Protocol â€“ UDP, Port Range â€“ 22, Source 175.45.116.100/32 is incorrect since the SSH protocol

        The option that says: Network ACL Inbound Rule:
         Protocol â€“ UDP, Port Range â€“ 22, Source 175.45.116.100/32 is incorrect since the SSH 
         protocol uses TCP and port 22, and not UDP. Aside from that, 
         network ACLs act as a firewall for your whole VPC subnet 
         while security groups operate on an instance level. 
         Since you are securing an EC2 instance, you should be using security groups.
        
        The option that says: Network ACL Inbound Rule:

          a: "Using a single PUT request to upload the large file ",
          b: "Using AWS Snowball ",
          c: "Using AWS Import/Export",
          d: "Use Multipart Upload",
        },
        correctAnswer: "d",
        explanation: `
        The total volume of data and number of objects you can store are unlimited. 
        Individual Amazon S3 objects can range in size from a minimum of 0 bytes to a maximum of 5 terabytes. 
        The largest object that can be uploaded in a single PUT is 5 gigabytes. 
        For objects larger than 100 megabytes, customers should consider using the Multipart Upload capability.

        The Multipart upload API enables you to upload large objects in parts. 
        You can use this API to upload new large objects or make a copy of an existing object.
         Multipart uploading is a three-step process: you initiate the upload, you upload the object parts, 
         and after you have uploaded all the parts, you complete the multipart upload.
         Upon receiving the complete multipart upload request, 
         Amazon S3 constructs the object from the uploaded parts and you
          can then access the object just as you would any other object in your bucket.
        
        Using a single PUT request to upload the large file is incorrect 
        because the largest file size you can upload using a single PUT request is 5 GB.
         Files larger than this will fail to be uploaded.
        
        Using AWS Snowball is incorrect because this is a migration tool that lets you 
        transfer large amounts of data from your on-premises data center to AWS S3 and vice versa. 
        This tool is not suitable for the given scenario. And when you provision Snowball, 
        the device gets transported to you, and not to your customers. 
        Therefore, you bear the responsibility of securing the device.
        
        Using AWS Import/Export is incorrect because Import/Export is 
        similar to AWS Snowball in such a way that it is meant to be used as a migration tool, 
        and not for multiple customer consumption such as in the given scenario.

        correctAnswer: "b",
        explanation: `
        Amazon VPC offers you the flexibility to fully manage both sides of
         your Amazon VPC connectivity by creating a VPN connection between your 
         remote network and a software VPN appliance running in your Amazon VPC network. 
         This option is recommended if you must manage both ends of the VPN connection 
         either for compliance purposes or for leveraging gateway devices 
         that are not currently supported by Amazon VPCâ€™s VPN solution.

        You can create an IPsec VPN connection between your VPC and your remote network. 
        On the AWS side of the VPN connection, a virtual private gateway 
        provides two VPN endpoints (tunnels) for automatic failover. 
        You configure your customer gateway on the remote side of the VPN connection. 
        If you have more than one remote network (for example, multiple branch offices), 
        you can create multiple AWS managed VPN connections via your virtual private gateway 
        to enable communication between these networks.
        
        With AWS Site-to-Site VPN, you can connect to an Amazon VPC in the cloud the same 
        way you connect to your branches. AWS Site-to-Site VPN establishes secure and private 
        sessions with IP Security (IPSec) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) tunnels.
        
        Hence, the correct answer is the option that says: It allows you to connect your 
        AWS cloud resources to your on-premises data center using secure and private
         sessions with IP Security (IPSec) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) tunnels since
          one of the main advantages of having a VPN connection is that you will be 
          able to connect your Amazon VPC to other remote networks securely.
        
        The option that says: It provides a cost-effective, hybrid connection from 
        your VPC to your on-premises data centers which bypasses the public Internet is incorrect.
         Although it is true that a VPN provides a cost-effective, hybrid connection 
         from your VPC to your on-premises data centers, it certainly does not bypass the public Internet. 
         A VPN connection actually goes through the public Internet,
          unlike the AWS Direct Connect connection which has a direct and 
          dedicated connection to your on-premises network.
        
        The option that says: It provides a networking connection between 
        two VPCs which enables you to route traffic between them using
         private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses is incorrect 
         because this actually describes VPC Peering and not a VPN connection.
        
        The option that says: It enables you to establish a private and 
        dedicated network connection between your network and your VPC is 
        incorrect because this is the advantage of an AWS Direct Connect connection and not a VPN.

          `,
        },
        correctAnswer: "c",
        explanation: `
Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully 
managed message queuing service that makes it easy to decouple and
scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. 
Building applications from individual components that each perform a 
discrete function improves scalability and reliability, and is best practice design for modern applications. 
SQS makes it simple and cost-effective to decouple and
coordinate the components of a cloud application.
Using SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, 
without losing messages or requiring other services to be always available.

The number of messages in your Amazon SQS queue does not solely define the number of instances needed. 
In fact, the number of instances in the fleet can be driven by multiple factors, 
including how long it takes to process a message and the acceptable amount of latency (queue delay).

The solution is to use a backlog per instance metric with the target value being
 the acceptable backlog per instance to maintain. You can calculate these numbers as follows:

Backlog per instance: To determine your backlog per instance, 
start with the Amazon SQS metric ApproximateNumberOfMessages 
to determine the length of the SQS queue (number of messages available for retrieval from the queue).
 Divide that number by the fleet's running capacity,
  which for an Auto Scaling group is the number of instances in the InService state, 
  to get the backlog per instance.

Acceptable backlog per instance: To determine your target value, 
first calculate what your application can accept in terms of latency.
 Then, take the acceptable latency value and divide it by the average 
 time that an EC2 instance takes to process a message.

To illustrate with an example, let's say that the current 
ApproximateNumberOfMessages is 1500 and the fleet's running capacity is 10. 
If the average processing time is 0.1 seconds for each message and 
the longest acceptable latency is 10 seconds then the acceptable backlog per instance is 10 / 0.1, 
which equals 100. This means that 100 is the target value for your target tracking policy.
 Because the backlog per instance is currently at 150 (1500 / 10),
  your fleet scales out by five instances to maintain proportion to the target value.

Hence, the correct answer is: Use an Amazon SQS queue to decouple the
 application components and scale-out the EC2 instances based upon
  the ApproximateNumberOfMessages metric in Amazon CloudWatch.

Replacing the Auto Scaling group with a cluster placement group 
to achieve a low-latency network performance necessary for 
tightly-coupled node-to-node communication is incorrect 
because although it is true that a cluster placement group allows you 
to achieve a low-latency network performance, you still need to
 use Auto Scaling for your architecture to add more EC2 instances.

Using larger instances for your application with an 
attached Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is incorrect because 
using a larger EC2 instance would not prevent data from being lost in case of a larger spike. 
You can take advantage of the durability and elasticity of SQS to keep the
 messages available for consumption by your instances. 
 Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is simply a network interface 
 for Amazon EC2 instances that enables customers to run
  applications requiring high levels of inter-node communications at scale on AWS.

Setting up Amazon Aurora Serverless for on-demand, auto-scaling 
configuration of your EC2 Instances and also enabling Amazon Aurora Parallel Query 
feature for faster analytical queries over your current data is incorrect 
because although the Amazon Aurora Parallel Query feature provides faster 
analytical queries over your current data, Amazon Aurora Serverless is an on-demand, 
auto-scaling configuration for your database, and NOT for your EC2 instances. 
This is actually an auto-scaling configuration for your
 Amazon Aurora database and not for your compute services.

        File Gateway presents a file-based interface to Amazon S3, which appears as a network file share. 
        It enables you to store and retrieve Amazon S3 objects through standard file storage protocols. 
        File Gateway allows your existing file-based applications or devices to use secure and 
        durable cloud storage without needing to be modified. 
        With File Gateway, your configured S3 buckets will be available as 
        Network File System (NFS) mount points or Server Message Block (SMB) file shares.

        To store the backup data from on-premises to a durable cloud storage service,
         you can use File Gateway to store and retrieve objects through standard 
         file storage protocols (SMB or NFS).
          File Gateway enables your existing file-based applications, devices, 
          and workflows to use Amazon S3, without modification. 
          File Gateway securely and durably stores both file contents 
          and metadata as objects while providing your on-premises 
          applications low-latency access to cached data.

        Hence, the correct answer is: Use the AWS Storage Gateway file gateway 
        to store all the backup data in Amazon S3.
        
       The option that says: Use the AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway 
        to store the backup data and directly access it using Amazon S3 API actions is incorrect. 
        Although this is a possible solution, you cannot directly access the volume gateway using Amazon S3 APIs.
         You should use File Gateway to access your data in Amazon S3.
        
        The option that says: Use Amazon EBS volumes to store all the backup data 
        and attached it to an Amazon EC2 instance is incorrect. 
        Take note that in the scenario, you are required to store the backup data in a durable storage service.
         An Amazon EBS volume is not highly durable like Amazon S3. 
         Also, file storage protocols such as NFS or SMB, are not directly supported by EBS.
        
        The option that says: Use AWS Snowball Edge to directly backup
         the data in Amazon S3 Glacier is incorrect because AWS Snowball Edge cannot store 
         and retrieve objects through standard file storage protocols.

        explanation: `
        Take note that the question asks about the viable mitigation techniques that are NOT suitable 
        to prevent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

        A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is an attack that can make your website or 
        application unavailable to end users. 
        To achieve this, attackers use a variety of techniques that consume network or other resources,
        disrupting access for legitimate end users.
        
        To protect your system from DDoS attack, you can do the following:
        
        - Use an Amazon CloudFront service for distributing both static and dynamic content.
        
        - Use an Application Load Balancer with Auto Scaling groups for your EC2 instances
         then restrict direct Internet traffic to your Amazon RDS database by deploying to a private subnet.
        
        - Set up alerts in Amazon CloudWatch to look for high Network In and CPU utilization metrics.
        
        Services that are available within AWS Regions, like Elastic Load Balancing and
         Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), allow you to build Distributed Denial of Service resiliency and 
         scale to handle unexpected volumes of traffic within a given region. 
         Services that are available in AWS edge locations, like Amazon CloudFront,
          AWS WAF, Amazon Route53, and Amazon API Gateway, allow you to take advantage 
          of a global network of edge locations that can provide your application with greater fault tolerance 
          and increased scale for managing larger volumes of traffic.
        
        In addition, you can also use AWS Shield and AWS WAF to fortify your cloud network.
         AWS Shield is a managed DDoS protection service that is available in two tiers:
          Standard and Advanced. AWS Shield Standard applies always-on detection and 
          inline mitigation techniques, such as deterministic packet filtering and
           priority-based traffic shaping, to minimize application downtime and latency.
        
        AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect web applications from 
        common web exploits that could affect application availability, 
        compromise security, or consume excessive resources. 
        You can use AWS WAF to define customizable web security rules that control 
        which traffic accesses your web applications. 
        If you use AWS Shield Advanced, you can use AWS WAF at no extra cost for 
        those protected resources and can engage the DRT to create WAF rules.

          c: "Amazon EC2",
          d: "Amazon CloudWatch",
        },
        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: `
        AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, 
        and risk auditing of your AWS account. With CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor,
        and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure.
        CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account activity, 
        including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, 
        and other AWS services. This event history simplifies security analysis, resource change tracking,
        and troubleshooting.

        CloudTrail provides visibility into user activity by recording actions taken on your account.
         CloudTrail records important information about each action, including who made the request, 
         the services used, the actions performed, parameters for the actions, and
          the response elements returned by the AWS service. 
          This information helps you to track changes made to your AWS resources and
           troubleshoot operational issues. CloudTrail makes it easier 
           to ensure compliance with internal policies and regulatory standards.
        
        Hence, the correct answer is: AWS CloudTrail.
        
        Amazon VPC is incorrect because a VPC is a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud

        It does not provide you the auditing information that were asked for in this scenario.
        
        Amazon EC2 is incorrect because EC2 is a service that provides secure,

        in this scenario just like the option above.
        
        Amazon CloudWatch is incorrect because this is a monitoring tool for your AWS resources. 
        Like the above options, it does not provide the needed information to satisfy the

        },
        correctAnswer: "b",
        explanation: `
        In this scenario, the best way to accomplish the requirement is to simply configure 
        the lifecycle configuration rules on the Amazon S3 bucket to purge the transaction logs after a month.

        Lifecycle configuration enables you to specify the lifecycle management of objects in a bucket. 
        The configuration is a set of one or more rules, 
        where each rule defines an action for Amazon S3 to apply to a group of objects. 
        These actions can be classified as follows:
        
        Transition actions â€“ In which you define when objects transition to another storage class. 
        For example, you may choose to transition objects to the STANDARD_IA (IA, for infrequent access)
         storage class 30 days after creation or 
         archive objects to the GLACIER storage class one year after creation.
        
        Expiration actions â€“ In which you specify when the objects expire. 
        Then Amazon S3 deletes the expired objects on your behalf.
        
        Hence, the correct answer is: Configure the lifecycle configuration rules on the Amazon S3 bucket
         to purge the transaction logs after a month.
        
        The option that says: Add a new bucket policy on the Amazon S3 bucket is incorrect as 
        it does not provide a solution to any of your needs in this scenario. 
        You add a bucket policy to a bucket to grant other AWS accounts or IAM users access permissions 
        for the bucket and the objects in it.
        
        The option that says: Create a new IAM policy for the Amazon S3 bucket 
        that automatically deletes the logs after a month is incorrect because
         IAM policies are primarily used to specify what actions are allowed or denied on your S3 buckets.
          You cannot configure an IAM policy to automatically purge logs for you in any way.
        
        The option that says: Enable CORS on the Amazon S3 bucket which will enable
         the automatic monthly deletion of data is incorrect.
          CORS allows client web applications that are loaded in one domain 
          to interact with resources in a different domain.

          a: `It securely delivers data to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds `,

          from your applications to the Read Replica`,
        },
        correctAnswer: "",
        explanation: `
        ElastiCache improves the performance of your database through caching query results.

        The primary purpose of an in-memory key-value store is to provide ultra-fast (submillisecond latency) 
        and inexpensive access to copies of data.
         Most data stores have areas of data that are frequently accessed but seldom updated. 
         Additionally, querying a database is always slower and more expensive than locating
          a key in a key-value pair cache. 
          Some database queries are especially expensive to perform, for example,
           queries that involve joins across multiple tables or queries with intensive calculations.
        
        By caching such query results, you pay the price of the query once and 
        then are able to quickly retrieve the data multiple times without having to re-execute the query.
        
        The option that says: It securely delivers data to customers globally with low latency
         and high transfer speeds is incorrect because this option describes what CloudFront 
         does and not ElastiCache.
        
        The option that says: It provides an in-memory cache that delivers
         up to 10x performance improvement from milliseconds to microseconds 
         or even at millions of requests per second is incorrect because 
         this option describes what Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) does and not ElastiCache.
          Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed, highly available, 
          in-memory cache for DynamoDB. Amazon ElastiCache cannot provide 
          a performance improvement from milliseconds to microseconds, 
          let alone millions of requests per second like DAX can.
        
        The option that says: It reduces the load on your database by routing
         read queries from your applications to the Read Replica is incorrect because
          this option describes what an RDS Read Replica does and not ElastiCache. 
          Amazon RDS Read Replicas enable you to create one or more read-only copies
           of your database instance within the same AWS Region or in a different AWS Region.

        },
        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: `
        The correct answers are the options that say:

        - Enable DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) and ensure that the Auto Scaling
         is enabled and increase the maximum provisioned read and write capacity.
        
        - Use API Gateway in conjunction with Lambda and turn on the caching on 
        frequently accessed data and enable DynamoDB global replication.
        
        Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed, highly available, 
        in-memory cache for DynamoDB that delivers 
        up to a 10x performance improvement â€“ from milliseconds to microseconds â€“ 
        even at millions of requests per second. DAX does all the heavy lifting 
        required to add in-memory acceleration to your DynamoDB tables, 
        without requiring developers to manage cache invalidation, data population, or cluster management.
        
Amazon API Gateway lets you create an API that acts as a "front door" for applications to access data,
 business logic, or functionality from your back-end services, such as code running on AWS Lambda. 
 Amazon API Gateway handles all of the tasks involved in accepting and 
 processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, 
 including traffic management, authorization and access control, 
 monitoring, and API version management. Amazon API Gateway has no minimum fees or startup costs.

AWS Lambda scales your functions automatically on your behalf. 
Every time an event notification is received for your function, 
AWS Lambda quickly locates free capacity within its compute fleet and runs your code. 
Since your code is stateless, AWS Lambda can start as many copies 
of your function as needed without lengthy deployment and configuration delays.

The option that says: Configure CloudFront with DynamoDB as the origin; 
cache frequently accessed data on the client device using ElastiCache is incorrect. 
Although CloudFront delivers content faster to your users using edge locations, 
you still cannot integrate DynamoDB table with CloudFront as these two are incompatible.

The option that says: Use AWS SSO and Cognito to authenticate users and 
have them directly access DynamoDB using single-sign on. 
Manually set the provisioned read and write capacity to a higher 
RCU and WCU is incorrect because AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) is a cloud 
SSO service that just makes it easy to centrally manage SSO access to multiple 
AWS accounts and business applications. This will not be of much help on the 
scalability and performance of the application. It is costly to 
manually set the provisioned read and write capacity to a higher 
RCU and WCU because this capacity will run round the clock and will 
still be the same even if the incoming traffic is stable and there is no need to scale.

The option that says: Since Auto Scaling is enabled by default, 
the provisioned read and write capacity will adjust automatically. 
Also enable DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) to improve the performance from milliseconds to microseconds
 is incorrect because, by default, Auto Scaling is not enabled 
 in a DynamoDB table which is created using the AWS CLI.

        Which is the MOST suitable solution that the Solutions Architect 
        should implement to provide low-latency network performance necessary for
         tightly-coupled node-to-node communication of the HPC cluster?

          c: `
          Set up a cluster placement group within a single Availability Zone in the same AWS Region.
          `,
          d: "Use EC2 Dedicated Instances",
        },
        correctAnswer: "c",
        explanation: `

 When you launch a new EC2 instance, the EC2 service attempts
 to place the instance in such a way that all of your instances 
 are spread out across underlying hardware to minimize correlated failures. 
 You can use placement groups to influence the placement of a 
 group of interdependent instances to meet the needs of your workload. 
 Depending on the type of workload, you can create a 
 placement group using one of the following placement strategies:

Cluster â€“ packs instances close together inside an Availability Zone. 
This strategy enables workloads to achieve the low-latency network 
performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication that is typical of HPC applications.

Partition â€“ spreads your instances across logical partitions 
such that groups of instances in one partition do not share 
the underlying hardware with groups of instances in different partitions. 
This strategy is typically used by large distributed and replicated 
workloads, such as Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka.

Spread â€“ strictly places a small group of instances across distinct 
underlying hardware to reduce correlated failures.

Cluster placement groups are recommended for applications that benefit from low network latency, 
high network throughput, or both. They are also recommended when 
the majority of the network traffic is between the instances in the group. 
To provide the lowest latency and the highest packet-per-second network performance 
for your placement group, choose an instance type that supports enhanced networking.



Partition placement groups can be used to deploy large distributed and 
replicated workloads, such as HDFS, HBase, and Cassandra, across distinct racks. 
When you launch instances into a partition placement group, Amazon EC2 tries 
to distribute the instances evenly across the number of partitions that you specify. 
You can also launch instances into a specific partition to have more control over where the instances are placed.



Spread placement groups are recommended for applications that have a small
 number of critical instances that should be kept separate from each other. 
 Launching instances in a spread placement group reduces the risk 
 of simultaneous failures that might occur when instances share the same racks. 
 Spread placement groups provide access to distinct racks, 
 and are therefore suitable for mixing instance types or launching instances over time.
  A spread placement group can span multiple Availability Zones in the same Region. 
  You can have a maximum of seven running instances per Availability Zone per group.



Hence, the correct answer is: Set up a cluster placement group within a single 
Availability Zone in the same AWS Region.

The option that says: Set up a spread placement group across 
multiple Availability Zones in multiple AWS Regions is incorrect because 
although using a placement group is valid for this particular scenario, 
you can only set up a placement group in a single AWS Region only. 
A spread placement group can span multiple Availability Zones in the same Region.

The option that says: Set up AWS Direct Connect connections across
 multiple Availability Zones for increased bandwidth throughput and 
 more consistent network experience is incorrect because this is primarily used for hybrid architectures. 
 It bypasses the public Internet and establishes a secure, 
 dedicated connection from your on-premises data center into AWS,
  and not used for having low latency within your AWS network.

The option that says: Use EC2 Dedicated Instances is incorrect because 
these are EC2 instances that run in a VPC on hardware that is dedicated 
to a single customer and are physically isolated at the host hardware 
level from instances that belong to other AWS accounts. It is not used for reducing latency.

        },
        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: `
A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables
 you to route traffic between them privately. 
 Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network. 
 You can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, 
 with a VPC in another AWS account, or with a VPC in a different AWS Region.



AWS uses the existing infrastructure of a VPC to create a VPC peering connection; 
it is neither a gateway nor a VPN connection and does not rely on a separate piece of physical hardware. 
There is no single point of failure for communication or a bandwidth bottleneck.

Creating a new entry to PROD in the DEV route table using 
the VPC peering connection as the target is incorrect because even if you configure the route tables,
 the two VPCs will still be disconnected until you set up a VPC peering connection between them.

Changing the DEV and PROD VPCs to have overlapping CIDR blocks to be able to connect them is incorrect
 because you cannot peer two VPCs with overlapping CIDR blocks.

The option that says: Do nothing. Since these two VPCs are already 
connected via UAT, they already have a connection to each other is incorrect as 
transitive VPC peering is not allowed hence, even though DEV and PROD are both connected in UAT,
 these two VPCs do not have a direct connection to each other.

        correctAnswer: "c",
        explanation: `
        he revoke-security-group-ingress command removes one or more ingress rules from a security group.

        Each rule consists of the protocol and the CIDR range or source security group. 
        For the TCP and UDP protocols, you must also specify the destination port or range of ports. 
        For the ICMP protocol, you must also specify the ICMP type and code.
         If the security group rule has a description, 
         you do not have to specify the description to revoke the rule.
        
        
        
        Rule changes are propagated to instances within the security group as quickly as possible. 
        However, a small delay might occur. 
        This example removes TCP port 22 access for the 203.0.113.0/24 address range 
        from the security group named MySecurityGroup. If the command succeeds, no output is returned.

        explanation: `
        In this scenario, the best option is to group the set of users in

        This will enable you to easily add, remove, and 
        manage the users instead of manually adding a policy to each and every 100 IAM users.

        Creating a new policy and applying it to multiple IAM users 
        using a shell script is incorrect because you need a new 
        IAM Group for this scenario and not assign a policy to each user via a shell script.
         This method can save you time but afterward,

        Creating a new IAM role and adding each user to the IAM role is 
        incorrect because you need to use an IAM Group and not an IAM role.

          c: "configuring an Active-Passive Failover with Multiple Primary and Secondary Resources",
          d: "Configuring an Active-Active Failover with One Primary and One Secondary Resource",
        },
        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: `
        ou can use Route 53 health checking to configure active-active and active-passive failover configurations. 
        You configure active-active failover using any routing policy (or combination of routing policies) 
        other than failover,
         and you configure active-passive failover using the failover routing policy.

         Active-Active Failover

         Use this failover configuration when you want all of your resources to be
          available the majority of the time. When a resource becomes unavailable, 
          Route 53 can detect that it's unhealthy and stop including it when responding to queries.
         
         In active-active failover, all the records that have the same name, 
         the same type (such as A or AAAA), and the same 
         routing policy (such as weighted or latency) are active unless Route 53 considers them unhealthy. 
         Route 53 can respond to a DNS query using any healthy record.
         
         Active-Passive Failover
         
         Use an active-passive failover configuration when you want a primary resource or 
         group of resources to be available the majority of the time and
         you want a secondary resource or group of resources to be on 
         standby in case all the primary resources become unavailable.
          When responding to queries, Route 53 includes only the healthy primary resources.
           If all the primary resources are unhealthy, 
           Route 53 begins to include only the healthy secondary resources in response to DNS queries.
         
         Configuring an Active-Passive Failover with Weighted Records and 
         configuring an Active-Passive Failover with Multiple Primary and Secondary 
         Resources are incorrect because an Active-Passive Failover is mainly used when you 
         want a primary resource or group of resources to be available most of the
          time and you want a secondary resource or group of resources to be on standby in 
          case all the primary resources become unavailable. In this scenario,
           all of your resources should be available all the time as much as possible
            which is why you have to use an Active-Active Failover instead.
         
         Configuring an Active-Active Failover with One Primary and 
         One Secondary Resource is incorrect because you cannot set up
          an Active-Active Failover with One Primary and One Secondary Resource. 
          Remember that an Active-Active Failover uses all available resources
           all the time without a primary nor a secondary resource.

          d: "Using AWS Shield and WAF",
        },
        correctAnswer: "c",
        explanation: `
        Enabling EBS Encryption and enabling Amazon S3 Server-Side or use Client-Side Encryption are correct.
         Amazon EBS encryption offers a simple encryption solution for your EBS volumes without
         the need to build, maintain, and secure your own key management infrastructure.

         In Amazon S3, data protection refers to protecting data 
         while in-transit (as it travels to and from Amazon S3) and 
         at rest (while it is stored on disks in Amazon S3 data centers). 
         You can protect data in transit by using SSL or by using client-side encryption. 
         You have the following options to protect data at rest in Amazon S3.

Use Server-Side Encryption â€“ You request Amazon S3 to encrypt your object before
 saving it on disks in its data centers and decrypt it when you download the objects.

Use Client-Side Encryption â€“ You can encrypt data client-side and upload the encrypted data to Amazon S3.
 In this case, you manage the encryption process, the encryption keys, and related tools.

Creating an EBS Snapshot is incorrect because this is a backup solution of EBS.
 It does not provide security of data inside EBS volumes when executed.

Migrating the EC2 instances from the public to private subnet is incorrect 
because the data you want to secure are those in EBS volumes and S3 buckets. 
Moving your EC2 instance to a private subnet involves a different matter of security practice,
 which does not achieve what you want in this scenario.

Using AWS Shield and WAF is incorrect because these protect you from common 
security threats for your web applications. However, what you are trying to
 achieve is securing and encrypting your data inside EBS and S3.

           to the Internet through the customer gateway (CGW`,
        },
        correctAnswer: "b",
        explanation: `
        Your VPC has an implicit router, and you use route tables to control where network traffic is directed. 
        Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table,
         which controls the routing for the subnet (subnet route table).
         You can explicitly associate a subnet with a particular route table.
          Otherwise, the subnet is implicitly associated with the main route table.

        A subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time,
         but you can associate multiple subnets with the same subnet route table.
          You can optionally associate a route table with an internet gateway or
           a virtual private gateway (gateway route table). 
           This enables you to specify routing rules for inbound traffic 
           that enters your VPC through the gateway
        
        Be sure that the subnet route table also has a route entry to the internet gateway.
         If this entry doesn't exist, the instance is in a private subnet and is inaccessible from the internet.
        
        In cases where your EC2 instance cannot be accessed from the Internet (or vice versa), 
        you usually have to check two things:
        
        - Does it have an EIP or public IP address?
        
        - Is the route table properly configured?


        Below are the correct answers:

- Amazon EC2 instance does not have a public IP address associated with it.

- The route table is not configured properly to send traffic from 
the EC2 instance to the Internet through the Internet gateway.

The option that says: The Amazon EC2 instance is not a member 
of the same Auto Scaling group is incorrect since Auto Scaling Groups
 do not affect Internet connectivity of EC2 instances.

The option that says: The Amazon EC2 instance doesn't have an
 attached Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is incorrect because
  the Elastic Fabric Adapter is just a network device that you
   can attach to your Amazon EC2 instance to accelerate High 
   Performance Computing (HPC) and machine learning applications. 
   EFA enables you to achieve the application performance of an on-premises HPC cluster, 
   with the scalability, flexibility, and elasticity provided by AWS. 
   However, this component is not required in order for your EC2 instance to access the public Internet.

The option that says: The route table is not configured properly to 
send traffic from the EC2 instance to the Internet through the customer
 gateway (CGW) is incorrect since CGW is used when you are setting up a VPN. 
 The correct gateway should be an Internet gateway.

A large telecommunications company needs to run analytics against all combined log

Which AWS services can be used together to collect logs and then easily perform log analysis?
     `,
        answers: {
          a: "Amazon S3 for storing ELB log files and Amazon EMR for analyzing the log files",
          b: "Amazon DynamoDB for storing and EC2 for analyzing the logs",

          Amazon S3 for storing the ELB log files and 
          an EC2 instance for analyzing the log files using a custom-built application
          `,
        },
        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: `
        In this scenario, it is best to use a combination of Amazon S3 and Amazon EMR: 
        Amazon S3 for storing ELB log files and Amazon EMR for analyzing the log files. 
        Access logging in the ELB is stored in Amazon S3 which means that the following are valid options:

        - Amazon S3 for storing the ELB log files and an EC2 instance for
         analyzing the log files using a custom-built application.
        
        - Amazon S3 for storing ELB log files and Amazon EMR for analyzing the log files.
        
        However, log analysis can be automatically provided by Amazon EMR, 
        which is more economical than building a custom-built log analysis application 
        and hosting it in EC2. Hence, the option that says:
         Amazon S3 for storing ELB log files and Amazon EMR for analyzing the log files
          is the best answer between the two.
        
        Access logging is an optional feature of Elastic Load Balancing that is disabled by default.
         After you enable access logging for your load balancer,
          Elastic Load Balancing captures the logs and 
          stores them in the Amazon S3 bucket that you specify as compressed files. 
          You can disable access logging at any time.
        
        Amazon EMR provides a managed Hadoop framework that makes it easy, fast, 
        and cost-effective to process vast amounts of data across dynamically scalable Amazon EC2 instances.
         It securely and reliably handles a broad set of big data use cases,
          including log analysis, web indexing, data transformations (ETL),
           machine learning, financial analysis, scientific simulation, and bioinformatics.
            You can also run other popular distributed frameworks such as Apache Spark, 
            HBase, Presto, and Flink in Amazon EMR, and
             interact with data in other AWS data stores such as Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB.
        
        The option that says: Amazon DynamoDB for storing and EC2 for analyzing the 
        logs is incorrect because DynamoDB is a noSQL database solution of AWS. 
        It would be inefficient to store logs in DynamoDB while using EC2 to analyze them.
        
        The option that says: Amazon EC2 with EBS volumes for storing and 
        analyzing the log files is incorrect because using EC2 with EBS would be costly, 
        and EBS might not provide the most durable storage for your logs, unlike S3.
        
        The option that says: Amazon S3 for storing the ELB log files and an EC2 instance 
        for analyzing the log files using a custom-built application is incorrect 
        because using EC2 to analyze logs would be inefficient and expensive since 
        you will have to program the analyzer yourself.

        },
        correctAnswer: "d",
        explanation: `
        AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works 
        with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
         Fargate makes it easy for you to focus on building your applications. 
         Fargate removes the need to provision and manage servers, 
         lets you specify and pay for resources per application,
          and improves security through application isolation by design.

        Fargate allocates the right amount of compute, eliminating the need to choose instances
         and scale cluster capacity. You only pay for the resources required to run your containers,
          so there is no over-provisioning and paying for additional servers.
           Fargate runs each task or pod in its own kernel providing 
           the tasks and pods their own isolated compute environment. 
           This enables your application to have workload isolation and 
           improved security by design. This is why customers such as Vanguard,
            Accenture, Foursquare, and Ancestry have chosen to run their mission critical applications on Fargate.
        
        
        
        Hence, the correct answer is: AWS Fargate.
        
        Amazon EKS is incorrect because this is more suitable to run

        The best option to take is to deploy four EC2 instances in one 
        Availability Zone and four in another availability zone in the 
        same region behind an Amazon Elastic Load Balancer. In this way, 
        if one availability zone goes down, there is still another available zone that can accommodate traffic.

        When the first AZ goes down, the second AZ will only have an initial 4 EC2 instances.
         This will eventually be scaled up to 8 instances since the solution is using Auto Scaling.
        
        The 110% compute capacity for the 4 servers might cause some degradation of the service, 
        but not a total outage since there are still some instances that handle the requests. 
        Depending on your scale-up configuration in your Auto Scaling group,
         the additional 4 EC2 instances can be launched in a matter of minutes.
        
        T3 instances also have a Burstable Performance capability to burst or
         go beyond the current compute capacity of the instance to 
         higher performance as required by your workload.
          So your 4 servers will be able to manage 110% compute capacity for a short period of time.
           This is the power of cloud computing versus our on-premises network architecture.
            It provides elasticity and unparalleled scalability.
        
        Take note that Auto Scaling will launch additional EC2 instances 
        to the remaining Availability Zone/s in the event of an Availability Zone outage in the region.
         Hence, the correct answer is the option that says:
          Deploy four EC2 instances with Auto Scaling in
           one Availability Zone and four in another availability zone
            in the same region behind an Amazon Elastic Load Balancer.
        
        The option that says: Deploy eight EC2 instances 
        with Auto Scaling in one Availability Zone behind an
         Amazon Elastic Load Balancer is incorrect because this architecture is not highly available.
          If that Availability Zone goes down then your web application will be unreachable.
        
        The options that say: Deploy four EC2 instances with Auto Scaling 
        in one region and four in another region behind an Amazon Elastic Load Balancer 
        and Deploy two EC2 instances with Auto Scaling in four regions behind 
        an Amazon Elastic Load Balancer are incorrect because the ELB 
        is designed to only run in one region and not across multiple regions.

          `,
        },
        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: `

        The Amazon S3 notification feature enables you to receive notifications
         when certain events happen in your bucket. To enable notifications, 
         you must first add a notification configuration that identifies the 
         events you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destinations where
          you want Amazon S3 to send the notifications. 
          You store this configuration in the notification subresource that is associated with a bucket.
           Amazon S3 provides an API for you to manage this subresource.

Amazon S3 event notifications typically deliver events in seconds but can sometimes take a minute or longer. 
If two writes are made to a single non-versioned object at the same time, 
it is possible that only a single event notification will be sent. 
If you want to ensure that an event notification is sent for every successful write, 
you can enable versioning on your bucket. 
With versioning, every successful write will create a new version of your object
 and will also send an event notification.



Amazon S3 can publish notifications for the following events:

1. New object created events

2. Object removal events

3. Restore object events

4. Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) object lost events

5. Replication events



Amazon S3 supports the following destinations where it can publish events:

1. Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic

2. Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue

3. AWS Lambda


If your notification ends up writing to the bucket that triggers the notification, 
this could cause an execution loop. For example, if the bucket triggers 
a Lambda function each time an object is uploaded and the function uploads an object to the bucket,
 then the function indirectly triggers itself. To avoid this, use two buckets,
  or configure the trigger to only apply to a prefix used for incoming objects.

Hence, the correct answers is: Create a new Amazon SNS topic and Amazon SQS queue.
 Add an S3 event notification configuration on the bucket to 
 publish s3:ObjectCreated:* and s3:ObjectRemoved:Delete event types to SQS and SNS.

The option that says: Create a new Amazon SNS topic and Amazon MQ.
 Add an S3 event notification configuration
  on the bucket to publish s3:ObjectAdded:* and s3:ObjectRemoved:* event types to SQS and SNS is incorrect because there is no s3:ObjectAdded:* type in Amazon S3. You should add an S3 event notification configuration on the bucket to publish events of the s3:ObjectCreated:* type instead. Moreover, Amazon S3 does not support Amazon MQ as a destination to publish events.

The option that says: Create a new Amazon SNS topic and Amazon SQS queue.
 Add an S3 event notification configuration on the
  bucket to publish s3:ObjectCreated:* and ObjectRemoved:DeleteMarkerCreated event types to SQS and SNS 
  is incorrect because the s3:ObjectRemoved:DeleteMarkerCreated type is only triggered 
  when a delete marker is created for a versioned object and not when an object is deleted 
  or a versioned object is permanently deleted.

The option that says: Create a new Amazon SNS topic and Amazon MQ. 
Add an S3 event notification configuration on the
 bucket to publish s3:ObjectCreated:* and ObjectRemoved:DeleteMarkerCreated event types to SQS and
  SNS is incorrect because Amazon S3 does public event messages to Amazon MQ.
   You should use an Amazon SQS instead. 
   In addition, the s3:ObjectRemoved:DeleteMarkerCreated type is only triggered 
   when a delete marker is created for a versioned object. 
   Remember that the scenario asked to publish events when an object is 
   deleted or a versioned object is permanently deleted.

        explanation: `
        Data protection refers to protecting data while
         in-transit (as it travels to and from Amazon S3) and
          at rest (while it is stored on disks in Amazon S3 data centers). 
          You can protect data in transit by using SSL or by using client-side encryption.
           You have the following options for protecting data at rest in Amazon S3:

        Use Server-Side Encryption â€“ You request Amazon S3 to encrypt your
         object before saving it on disks in its data centers and decrypt it when you download the objects.
        
        Use Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)
        
        Use Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS-Managed Keys (SSE-KMS)
        
        Use Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C)
        
        Use Client-Side Encryption â€“ You can encrypt data client-side and
         upload the encrypted data to Amazon S3. In this case, 
         you manage the encryption process, the encryption keys, and related tools.
        
        Use Client-Side Encryption with AWS KMSâ€“Managed Customer Master Key (CMK)
        
        Use Client-Side Encryption Using a Client-Side Master Key

        Hence, the correct answers are:

- Set up Client-Side Encryption with a customer master key stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).

- Set up Client-Side Encryption using a client-side master key.

The option that says: Set up Server-Side Encryption with keys stored
 in a separate S3 bucket is incorrect because you have to use AWS KMS to
  store your encryption keys or alternatively, choose an AWS-managed CMK 
  instead to properly implement Server-Side Encryption in Amazon S3. 
  In addition, storing any type of encryption key in Amazon S3 is actually a security risk and is not recommended.

The option that says: Set up Client-Side encryption with Amazon S3 
managed encryption keys is incorrect because
 you can't have an Amazon S3 managed encryption key for client-side encryption. 
 As its name implies, an Amazon S3 managed key is fully managed by AWS and also 
 rotates the key automatically without any manual intervention. 
 For this scenario, you have to set up a customer master key (CMK) in AWS KMS that you can manage, rotate, 
 and audit or alternatively, use a client-side master key that you manually maintain.

The option that says: Set up Server-Side encryption 
(SSE) with EC2 key pair is incorrect because you can't 
use a key pair of your Amazon EC2 instance for encrypting your S3 bucket. 
You have to use a client-side master key or a customer master key stored in AWS KMS.

        },
        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: `
        This question did not mention the specific type of EC2 instance however, 
        it says that it will be stopped and started. 
        Since only EBS-backed instances can be stopped and restarted,
         it is implied that the instance is EBS-backed. 
         Remember that an instance store-backed instance can only be rebooted or terminated 
         and its data will be erased if the EC2 instance is either stopped or terminated.

        If you stopped an EBS-backed EC2 instance, the volume is preserved 
        but the data in any attached instance store volume will be erased. 
        Keep in mind that an EC2 instance has an underlying physical host computer. 
        If the instance is stopped, AWS usually moves the instance to a new host computer.
        Your instance may stay on the same host computer if there are no problems with the host computer. 
        In addition, its Elastic IP address is disassociated from the instance if it is an EC2-Classic instance. 
        Otherwise, if it is an EC2-VPC instance, the Elastic IP address remains associated.
        
        Take note that an EBS-backed EC2 instance can have attached Instance Store volumes. 
        This is the reason why there is an option that mentions the Instance Store volume,
         which is placed to test your understanding of this specific storage type. 
         You can launch an EBS-backed EC2 instance and attach several Instance Store volumes
          but remember that there are some EC2 Instance types that don't support this kind of set up:
        
        Hence, the correct answers are:
        
        - The underlying host for the instance is possibly changed.
        
        - All data on the attached instance-store devices will be lost.
        
        The option that says: The ENI (Elastic Network Interface) is detached is incorrect 
        because the ENI will stay attached even if you stopped your EC2 instance.
        
        The option that says: The Elastic IP address is disassociated with the instance is incorrect
         because the EIP will actually remain associated with your instance even after stopping it.
        
        The option that says: There will be no changes is incorrect 
        because there will be a lot of possible changes in your EC2 instance once you stop and start it again.
         AWS may move the virtualized EC2 instance to another host computer; 
         the instance may get a new public IP address, 
         and the data in your attached instance store volumes will be deleted.

        },
        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: `
        In this scenario, you can use lifecycle policies in S3 to automatically move obsolete data to Glacier.

        Lifecycle configuration in Amazon S3 enables you to specify the lifecycle management of objects in a bucket. 
        The configuration is a set of one or more rules, 
        where each rule defines an action for Amazon S3 to apply to a group of objects. 
    
        These actions can be classified as follows:

Transition actions â€“ In which you define when objects transition to another storage class. 
For example, you may choose to transition objects 
to the STANDARD_IA (IA, for infrequent access) storage class 30 days after creation, 
or archive objects to the GLACIER storage class one year after creation.

Expiration actions â€“ In which you specify when the objects expire. 
Then Amazon S3 deletes the expired objects on your behalf.

The option that says: Use an EC2 instance and a scheduled job 
to transfer the obsolete data from their S3 location to Amazon S3 Glacier is incorrect 
because you don't need to create a scheduled job in EC2 as you can simply use the lifecycle policy in S3.

The option that says: Use Amazon SQS is incorrect as SQS is not a storage service. 
Amazon SQS is primarily used to decouple your
 applications by queueing the incoming requests of your application.

The option that says: Use CloudEndure Migration is incorrect because this
 service is just a highly automated lift-and-shift (rehost) solution that simplifies,
  expedites, and reduces the cost of migrating applications to AWS. 
  You cannot use this to automatically transition your S3 objects to a cheaper storage class.

         the application accesses objects from S3 bucket. 
         The development team investigated the application logic and didnâ€™t find any issues.

        Which of the following is the MOST likely cause of this issue?

     `,

          a: "The data analytics application is designed to fetch parts of objects from the S3 bucket using a range header ",
          b: "The data analytics application is designed to fetch objects from the S3 bucket using parallel requests.",
          c: "The data analytics application is designed to use atomic updates across object keys",
          d: "he data analytics application is designed to update its data with an object-locking mechanism",
        },
        correctAnswer: "b",
        explanation: `
        Amazon S3 provides read-after-write consistency for 
        PUTS of new objects in your S3 bucket in all regions with one caveat:
         if you make a HEAD or GET request to the key name (to find if the object exists) before 
         creating the object, Amazon S3 provides eventual consistency for read-after-write.
          Amazon S3 offers eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES in all regions.



        Updates to a single key are atomic. For example, if you PUT to an existing key, 
        a subsequent read might return the old data or the updated data, 
        but it will never return corrupted or partial data. 
        This usually happens if your application is using parallel requests on the same object.
        
        Amazon S3 achieves high availability by replicating data across 
        multiple servers within Amazon's data centers. 
        If a PUT request is successful, your data is safely stored. 
        However, information about the changes must replicate across Amazon S3,
         which can take some time, and so you might observe the following behaviors:
        
        - A process writes a new object to Amazon S3 and immediately lists keys within its bucket. 
        Until the change is fully propagated, the object might not appear in the list.
        
        - A process replaces an existing object and immediately attempts to read it. 
        Until the change is fully propagated, Amazon S3 might return the prior data.
        
        - A process deletes an existing object and immediately attempts to read it.
         Until the deletion is fully propagated, Amazon S3 might return the deleted data.
        
        - A process deletes an existing object and immediately lists keys within its bucket. 
        Until the deletion is fully propagated, Amazon S3 might list the deleted object.
        
        Amazon S3â€™s support for parallel requests means you can scale your S3 performance by 
        the factor of your compute cluster, without making any customizations to your application. 
        Amazon S3 does not currently support Object Locking. 
        If two PUT requests are simultaneously made to the same key, the request with the latest timestamp wins.
         If this is an issue, you will need to build an object-locking mechanism into your application.
        
        Updates are key-based; there is no way to make atomic updates across keys.
         For example, you cannot make the update of one key dependent 
         on the update of another key unless you design this functionality into your application.
        
        Hence, the correct answer is the option that says: 
        The data analytics application is designed to fetch objects from the S3 bucket using parallel requests.
        
        The option that says: The data analytics application is designed 
        to fetch parts of objects from the S3 bucket using a range header 
        is incorrect because using a Range header is primarily used to 
        retrieve an object in parts and is unlikely the root cause on why 
        the application is intermittently getting old data.
         Using the Range HTTP header in a GET request, 
         you can retrieve a specific range of bytes in an object stored in Amazon S3.
          With this, you can resume fetching other parts of the object whenever your application is ready. 
          This resumable download is useful when you need only portions of your object data.
           It is also useful where network connectivity is poor and you need to react to failures.
        
        The option that says: The data analytics application is
         designed to use atomic updates across object keys is incorrect 
         because the update operations are key-based which means that 
         there is no way to make atomic updates across keys. Hence, this is not the root cause of this issue.
        
        The option that says: The data analytics application is designed to 
        update its data with an object-locking mechanism is incorrect because 
        an object-locking mechanism will actually safeguard the application from 
        the issue of getting obsolete data and not the other way around. 
        Moreover, Amazon S3 does not currently support Object Locking for concurrent updates. 
        Take note that this is different from the 
        Amazon S3 Object Lock feature which prevents an object
         from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. 
         The scenario mentioned here is about two or more clients
          that are concurrently accessing and updating the same object at the same time. 
          An "Object-locking" mechanism is a system that "locks" the 
          very first update request to the S3 object and blocks any concurrent 
          update requests to the same object.

        question: `
An application needs to retrieve a subset of data from a large CSV file stored
 in an Amazon S3 bucket by using simple SQL expressions. 
 The queries are made within Amazon S3 and must only return the needed data. 

Which of the following actions should be taken?
     `,
        answers: {
          a: "Perform an S3 Select operation based on the bucket's name and object's key. ",
          b: "Perform an S3 Select operation based on the bucket's name and object tags ",
          c: "Perform an S3 Select operation based on the bucket's name ",
          d: "Perform an S3 Select operation based on the bucket's name and object's metadata ",
        },
        correctAnswer: "a",
        explanation: `
        S3 Select enables applications to retrieve only a subset of data
         from an object by using simple SQL expressions. 
         By using S3 Select to retrieve only the data needed by your application, 
         you can achieve drastic performance increases.

         Amazon S3 is composed of buckets, object keys, object metadata, object tags, and many other components as shown below:

An Amazon S3 bucket name is globally unique, and the namespace is shared by all AWS accounts.

An Amazon S3 object key refers to the key name, which uniquely identifies the object in the bucket.

An Amazon S3 object metadata is a name-value pair that provides information about the object.

An Amazon S3 object tag is a key-pair value used for object tagging to categorize storage.

You can perform S3 Select to query only the necessary data inside the CSV files based on the bucket's name and the object's key.

The following snippet below shows how it is done using boto3 ( AWS SDK for Python ):

client = boto3.client('s3')
resp = client.select_object_content(
Bucket='tdojo-bucket', # Bucket Name.
Key='s3-select/tutorialsdojofile.csv', # Object Key.
ExpressionType= 'SQL',
Expression = "select \"Sample\" from s3object s where s.\"tutorialsdojofile\" in ['A', 'B']"

Hence, the correct answer is the option that says: 
Perform an S3 Select operation based on the bucket's name and object's key.

The option that says: Perform an S3 Select operation based 
on the bucket's name and object's metadata is incorrect because 
metadata is not needed when querying subsets of data in an object using S3 Select.

The option that says: Perform an S3 Select operation based on the bucket's 
name and object tags is incorrect because object tags just provide additional information to your object.
 This is not needed when querying with S3 Select although this can be
  useful for S3 Batch Operations. You can categorize objects based 
  on tag values to provide S3 Batch Operations with a list of objects to operate on.

The option that says: Perform an S3 Select operation based on the bucket's
 name is incorrect because you need both the bucketâ€™s 
 name and the object key to successfully perform an S3 Select operation.

        answers: {
          a: " Encrypted Amazon EC2 Instance Store using AWS KMS ",
          b: " Amazon EC2 Instance Store with SSL encryption ",
          c: "Encrypted Amazon EBS volume using AWS KMS",
          d: "Amazon EBS volume with server-side encryption (SSE) enabled ",
        },
        correctAnswer: "c",
        explanation: `
        Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. 
        EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices.
         You can mount these volumes as devices on your instances.
         EBS volumes that are attached to an instance are exposed 
        as storage volumes that persist independently from the life of the instance.
        Amazon EBS is the persistent block storage volume among the options given. 
        It is mainly used as the root volume to store the operating system of an EC2 instance.
         To encrypt an EBS volume at rest, you can use AWS KMS customer master keys for 
         the encryption of both the boot and data volumes of an EC2 instance.

        Hence, the correct answer is: Encrypted Amazon EBS volume using AWS KMS.
        
        The options that say: Amazon EC2 Instance Store with SSL encryption and
         Encrypted Amazon EC2 Instance Store using AWS KMS are both incorrect 
         because the scenario requires persistent block storage and not temporary storage. 
         Also, enabling SSL is not a requirement in the scenario as 
         it is primarily used to encrypt data in transit.
        
        The option that says: Amazon EBS volume with server-side encryption (SSE) enabled is
         incorrect because EBS volumes are only encrypted using AWS KMS.
          Server-side encryption (SSE) is actually an option for Amazon S3, but not for Amazon EC2.
